title = {Fast large volume simulations of the 21-cm signal from the reionization and pre-reionization epochs},
abstract = {While limited to low spatial resolution, the next-generation low-frequency radio interferometers that target 21-cm observations during the era of reionization and prior will have instantaneous fields of view that are many tens of deg2 on the sky. Predictions related to various statistical measurements of the 21-cm brightness temperature must then be pursued with numerical simulations of reionization with correspondingly large volume box sizes, of the order of 1000 Mpc on one side. We pursue a semi-numerical scheme to simulate the 21-cm signal during and prior to reionization by extending a hybrid approach where simulations are performed by first laying down the linear dark matter density field, accounting for the non-linear evolution of the density field based on second-order linear perturbation theory as specified by the Zel'dovich approximation, and then specifying the location and mass of collapsed dark matter haloes using the excursion-set formalism. The location of ionizing sources and the time evolving distribution of ionization field is also specified using an excursion-set algorithm. We account for the brightness temperature evolution through the coupling between spin and gas temperature due to collisions, radiative coupling in the presence of Lyman α photons and heating of the intergalactic medium, such as due to a background of X-ray photons. The hybrid simulation method we present is capable of producing the required large volume simulations with adequate resolution in a reasonable time, so a large number of realizations can be obtained with variations in assumptions related to astrophysics and background cosmology that govern the 21-cm signal.},

title = {A 20,000 Msolar Black Hole in the Stellar Cluster G1},
abstract = {We present the detection of a 2.0+1.4-0.8×104 Msolar black hole (BH) in the stellar cluster G1 (Mayall II), based on data taken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. G1 is one of the most massive stellar clusters in M31. The central velocity dispersion (25 km s-1) and the measured BH mass of G1 place it on a linear extrapolation of the correlation between BH mass and bulge velocity dispersion established for nearby galaxies. The detection of a BH in this low-mass stellar system suggests that (1) the most likely candidates for seed massive BHs come from stellar clusters, (2) there is a direct link between massive stellar clusters and normal galaxies, and (3) the formation process of both bulges and massive clusters is similar because of their concordance in the M*-σ relation. Globular clusters in our Galaxy should be searched for central BHs. Based on observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

However, the results must be calibrated to correct for the polarization transfer function of the receiving system. The transfer function for any device can be expressed by its Mueller matrix. We express the matrix elements in terms of fundamental system parameters that describe the voltage transfer functions (known as the Jones matrix) of the various system devices in physical terms and thus provide a means for comparing with engineering calculations and investigating the effects of design changes. We describe how to determine these parameters with astronomical observations. We illustrate the method by applying it to some of the receivers at the Arecibo Observatory.},

abstract = {The H I 21 cm transition line is expected to be an important probe into the cosmic dark ages and epoch of reionization. Foreground source removal is one of the principal challenges for the detection of this signal. This paper investigates the extragalactic point source contamination and how accurately bright sources (gsim1 Jy) must be removed in order to detect 21 cm emission with upcoming radio telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array. We consider the residual contamination in 21 cm maps and power spectra due to position errors in the sky model for bright sources, as well as frequency-independent calibration errors. We find that a source position accuracy of 0.1 arcsec will suffice for detection of the H I power spectrum. For calibration errors, 0.05% accuracy in antenna gain amplitude is required in order to detect the cosmic signal. Both sources of subtraction error produce residuals that are localized to small angular scales, k bottom >~ 0.05 Mpc-1, in the two-dimensional power spectrum.},

title = {Spectroscopic Imaging of the Dynamic Quiet Sun using the Murchison Widefield Array Prototype Interferometer},
abstract = {We will present results from recent spectroscopic imaging observations of the solar corona obtained with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Prototype interferometer. The 32-element MWA Prototype operates between 80-300 MHz and is a precursor to the full 512-element MWA that is currently under construction in Western Australia. The combination of high spectral resolution and high dynamic range imaging capabilities afforded by the MWA Prototype are already providing a wealth of new insights into the dynamic nature of the radio Sun. For example, during two separate days in late March 2010 (characterized as "quiet" to "very quiet" by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center), we have detected modest level broad-band bursts that are similar to classic Type III bursts in their duration and peak wavelengths. On one of these days, we also detected and imaged numerous short-lived, narrow-band events whose nature is clearly non-thermal, but whose properties, to our knowledge, do not match those of any other previously reported class of radio burst. All of the temporally variable features appear to be linked with x-ray-bright active regions. In some cases, we also observe circularly polarized emission at these locations. Our observations and analysis are ongoing, and we will use these and other new results to illustrate the powerful new capabilities for solar and heliospheric research that will be provided by the full MWA over the next several years. This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.},

title = {The global 21-centimeter background from high redshifts},
abstract = {We consider the evolution of the sky-averaged 21-cm background during the early phases of structure formation. Using simple analytic models, we calculate the thermal and ionization histories, assuming that stellar photons dominate the radiation background. The resulting 21-cm spectra can constrain the properties of the first generations of stars and quasars. If Population II stars dominate, Lyα coupling renders the intergalactic medium (IGM) visible before it is heated by X-rays and long before reionization. Thus the 21-cm background has a strong absorption epoch followed by weaker emission that fades during reionization. The harder spectra of very massive Population III stars compress these transitions into a shorter time interval and decreases the signal amplitude. However, the reionization epoch will remain visible except in extreme cases. The global 21-cm signal will be challenging to observe because of astronomical foregrounds, but it offers an exciting opportunity to study the first sources of light. It also fixes the overall amplitude of the fluctuating background whose detection is a major goal of several next-generation low-frequency radio interferometers.},

title = {Massive black holes in globular clusters},
abstract = {It is proposed that the observed X-ray emission in globular star clusters may be caused by the accretion of gas onto a massive black hole at the center of a cluster. The amount of accreting gas is estimated for a model cluster together with the minimum black hole mass and the X-ray luminosity. It is shown that the X-ray emission should be pointlike and located at the center of the cluster, and that there should be no eclipses and no orbital or spin periods observed in the X-ray flux. Possible explanations are considered for the model limitation that only a small fraction of the globular clusters in the galaxy are X-ray sources.},

abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a dipole-based aperture array synthesis telescope designed to operate in the 80-300 MHz frequency range. It is capable of a wide range of science investigations, but is initially focused on three key science projects. These are detection and characterization of 3-dimensional brightness temperature fluctuations in the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) at redshifts from 6 to 10, solar imaging and remote sensing of the inner heliosphere via propagation effects on signals from distant background sources,and high-sensitivity exploration of the variable radio sky. The array design features 8192 dual-polarization broad-band active dipoles, arranged into 512 tiles comprising 16 dipoles each. The tiles are quasi-randomly distributed over an aperture 1.5km in diameter, with a small number of outliers extending to 3km. All tile-tile baselines are correlated in custom FPGA-based hardware, yielding a Nyquist-sampled instantaneous monochromatic uv coverage and unprecedented point spread function (PSF) quality. The correlated data are calibrated in real time using novel position-dependent self-calibration algorithms. The array is located in the Murchison region of outback Western Australia. This region is characterized by extremely low population density and a superbly radio-quiet environment,allowing full exploitation of the instrumental capabilities.},

title = {Power spectrum extraction for redshifted 21-cm Epoch of Reionization experiments: the LOFAR case},
abstract = {ABSTRACT One of the aims of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Epoch of Reionization (EoR) project is to measure the power spectrum of variations in the intensity of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the EoR. The sensitivity with which this power spectrum can be estimated depends on the level of thermal noise and sample variance, and also on the systematic errors arising from the extraction process, in particular from the subtraction of foreground contamination. We model the extraction process using realistic simulations of the cosmological signal, the foregrounds and noise, and so estimate the sensitivity of the LOFAR EoR experiment to the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum. Detection of emission from the EoR should be possible within 360 h of observation with a single station beam. Integrating for longer, and synthesizing multiple station beams within the primary (tile) beam, then enables us to extract progressively more accurate estimates of the power at a greater range of scales and redshifts. We discuss different observational strategies which compromise between depth of observation, sky coverage and frequency coverage. A plan in which lower frequencies receive a larger fraction of the time appears to be promising. We also study the nature of the bias which foreground fitting errors induce on the inferred power spectrum and discuss how to reduce and correct for this bias. The angular and line-of-sight power spectra have different merits in this respect, and we suggest considering them separately in the analysis of LOFAR data.},

title = {Bayesian detection of radar interference in radio astronomy},
abstract = {L-Band observations at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and other radio observatories are often made in frequency bands allocated to aviation pulsed radar transmissions. It is possible to mitigate radar contamination of the astronomical signal by time blanking data containing these pulses. However, even when strong direct path pulses and nearby fixed clutter echoes are removed there are still undetected weaker aircraft echoes present which can corrupt the data. In a previous paper we presented an algorithm to improve real-time echo blanking by forming a Kalman filter tracker to follow the path of a sequence of echoes observed on successive radar antenna sweeps. The tracker builds a history which can be used to predict the location of upcoming echoes. We now present details of a new Bayesian detection algorithm which uses this prediction information to enable more sensitive weak pulse acquisition. The developed track information is used to form a spatial prior probability distribution for the presence of the next echoes. Regions with higher probability are processed with a lower detection threshold to pull out low level pulses without increasing the overall probability of false alarm detection. The ultimate result is more complete removal, by blanking the detected pulse, of radar corruption in astronomical observations.},

abstract = {We consider a troublesome form of nonisoplanatism in synthesis radio telescopes: noncoplanar baselines. We present a novel interpretation of the noncoplanar baselines effect as being due to differential Fresnel diffraction in the neighborhood of the array antennas. We have developed a new algorithm to deal with this effect. Our new algorithm, which we call ldquoW-projectionrdquo, has markedly superior performance compared to existing algorithms. At roughly equivalent levels of accuracy, W-projection can be up to an order of magnitude faster than the corresponding facet-based algorithms. Furthermore, the precision of result is not tightly coupled to computing time. W-projection has important consequences for the design and operation of the new generation of radio telescopes operating at centimeter and longer wavelengths},

title = {Seeing Galaxies through Thick and Thin. IV. The Superposed Spiral Galaxies of NGC 3314},
abstract = {The superposed pair of spiral galaxies making up NGC 3314 offers a unique opportunity to trace the dust properties in a spiral galaxy. We analyze multicolor Hubble Space Telescope imaging, supported by ground-based near-IR imaging and fiber-array spectroscopy, to measure dust extinction in the foreground Sc galaxy NGC 3314A, which is backlit by the Sb system NGC 3314B. The superposition allows us to measure extinctions over a wide range of galactocentric radii in the foreground galaxy from 0.4-4.5 kpc. In the outer half of the disk, the extinction is strongly localized in discrete dust lanes, including some patches whose galactic setting is clear only because of associated Hα emission at the foreground velocity. These dust features show an extinction curve with a slope close to the Galactic mean (R=3.5+/-0.3) over a range in galactocentric radius from 1.6 to 3.8 kpc, with no radial trend. Using the I-K color of the background nucleus, we derive an extinction of AI=3.3 through the disk at a projected distance of 400 pc from the nucleus of NGC 3314A. The extinction in even the inner disk of NGC 3314A is quite patchy, since background Hα emission is detected from all parts of the system. Local anticorrelations between foreground and background line emission demonstrate that the dust is concentrated in star-forming regions, as has been found for the blue light in several systems. The colors of the dust lanes in NGC 3314A that are projected only partially against the background disk indicate that the dust scale height in the foreground disk is substantially smaller than that of the stars. The color-intensity behavior of the net light in these regions tracks the predictions of a thin-layer model closely.

title = {Foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line. II. Westerbork observations of the fields around 3C 196 and the North Celestial Pole},
abstract = {Context. In the coming years a new insight into galaxy formation and the thermal history of the Universe is expected to come from the detection of the highly redshifted cosmological 21 cm line. Aims: The cosmological 21 cm line signal is buried under Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which are likely to be a few orders of magnitude brighter. Strategies and techniques for effective subtraction of these foreground sources require a detailed knowledge of their structure in both intensity and polarization on the relevant angular scales of 1-30 arcmin. Methods: We present results from observations conducted with the Westerbork telescope in the 140-160 MHz range with 2 arcmin resolution in two fields located at intermediate Galactic latitude, centred around the bright quasar 3C 196 and the North Celestial Pole. They were observed with the purpose of characterizing the foreground properties in sky areas where actual observations of the cosmological 21 cm line could be carried out. The polarization data were analysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. We have computed total intensity and polarization angular power spectra. Results: Total intensity maps were carefully calibrated, reaching a high dynamic range, 150 000:1 in the case of the 3C 196 field. No evidence of diffuse Galactic emission was found in the angular power spectrum analysis on scales smaller than ~10 arcmin in either of the two fields. On these angular scales the signal is consistent with the classical confusion noise of ~3 mJy beam-1. On scales greater than 30 arcmin we found an excess of power attributed to the Galactic foreground with an rms of 3.4 K and 5.5 K for the 3C 196 and the NCP field respectively. The intermediate angular scales suffered from systematic errors which prevented any detection. Patchy polarized emission was found only in the 3C 196 field whereas the polarization in the NCP area was essentially due to radio frequency interference. The polarized signal in the 3C 196 field is close to the thermal noise for angular scales smaller than ~10 arcmin. On scales greater than 30 arcmin it has an rms value of 0.68 K. The polarized signal appears mainly at rotation measure values smaller than 4 rad m-2. Conclusions: In regard of the detection of the cosmological 21 cm line, we conclude that Galactic total intensity emission lacks small-scale power, which is below the confusion noise level at the angular resolution of 2 arcmin. Galactic polarization, given its relative weakness and its small rotation measure values, is less severe than expected as a contaminant of the cosmological 21 cm line.},

Several regions of strong galactic RM are identified, and their boundaries in (l, b) are well delineated for the first time. The largest feature dominates the RM sky; it is centered southward of the galactic plane at l = 90 deg and extends as far as b = 40 deg. It is shown that low RMs at high galactic latitudes are well correlated in sign over large angular scales (about 30 deg), and that they are influenced by the larger-scale prevailing magnetic fields. Various models of the prevailing magnetic field in the plane of the Galaxy are discussed; a bisymmetric spiral field model is proposed in which the prevailing magnetic field sense reverses at or near the Sagittarius arm. The effect of galactic loop I appears to cause a weak, large-scale modulation of the RMs at positive galactic latitudes.},

abstract = {The measurement of polarized radiation uses entirely different methods at optical and radio wavelengths. As a result, the algebraic analysis of polarimeter performance differs and, in the case of radio interferometry, is unnecessarily complicated. We demonstrate that the mathematical operation of outer matrix multiplication provides the missing link between the two approaches. Within one coherent framework, we then unite the concepts of Stokes parameters and Wolf coherency matrix, the Jones and Mueller calculi from optics, and the techniques of radio interferometry based on multiplying correlators. We relate the polarization performance of a complete radio interferometer to the (matrix) polarization properties of its successive signal processing stages, providing a clear view of how a radio polarimeter works. Our treatment also clarifies the nature of and the relations between the various types of transformations used in optical polarimetry. We develop the analysis from the radio interferometrist's point of view, but include enough background for a wider audience. In a companion paper, we discuss in more detail the application to the calibration of radio interferometer systems; in a third paper we investigate the IAU (1973) radio definition of the Stokes parameters and its precise translation into mathematical form.},

title = {The Granada workshop on High Redshift Radio Galaxies: An overview},
abstract = {The Granada workshop on High Redshift Radio Galaxies (HzRGs) gave an excellent overview of the progress that has been made in this field during the last 3 years. Here we briefly review some of the results, with an emphasis on what studies of HzRGs can teach us about the formation and evolution of massive galaxies, clusters and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of great relevance for this workshop are scenarios that describe certain aspects of the evolution of radio galaxies, including (i) the sequence of events after merging of galaxies that ultimately lead to extended powerful radio sources and (ii) the mass assembly and virialization of the hosting massive galaxies and their associated (proto-)clusters. Furthermore, I briefly discuss two projects that are important for a further understanding of AGN and high redshift radio galaxies. First, using the MIDI instrument mounted on the VLT Interferometer, the dusty tori of nearby AGN can be studied in the range of 8-13 micron at high angular resolution. The first result on the nearby AGN NGC 1068 as presented by Jaffe et al. (2004) indicated the presence of a hot (T > 800 K), compact (1 pc) component, possible identified with the base of the jet and a warm (270 K), well-resolved (3 × 4 pc) component associated with the alleged torus. Second, LOFAR is a new low frequency radio telescope that is currently being build in the Netherlands and is expected to be operational in 2008. With 50 stations spread over an area of 100 km in diameter, its resolution and sensitivity will be unprecedented in the frequency range 10-240 MHz. LOFAR will be a unique instrument that will impact a broad range of astrophysical topics varying from the epoch of reionisation, to gamma ray bursts and cosmic rays. Surveys with LOFAR will be of paramount importance for studies of HzRGs: It will enable (i) defining samples of radio galaxies with redshifts higher than 6, (ii) observations of starbursting galaxies in proto-clusters, and (iii) mapping out the low-frequency radio emission of virtually all northern radio-loud AGN in revolutionary detail.},

title = {Radio Polarization from the Inner Galaxy at Arcminute Resolution},
abstract = {The Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) is an H I and 1.4 GHz continuum survey of the fourth quadrant of the Galaxy at arcminute resolution. We present here results on linearly polarized continuum emission from an initial 28 deg2 test region for the SGPS, consisting of 190 mosaicked pointings of the Australia Telescope Compact Array and covering the range 325.5d<l<332.5d, -0.5d<b<3.5d. Complicated extended structure is seen in linear polarization throughout the test region, almost all of which has no correlation with total intensity. We interpret the brightest regions of polarized emission as representing intrinsic structure in extended polarization, most likely originating in the Crux spiral arm at a distance of 3.5 kpc; fainter polarized structure is imposed by Faraday rotation in foreground material. Two large areas in the field are devoid of polarization. We argue that these voids are produced by foreground H II regions in which the magnetic field is disordered on scales of ~0.1-0.2 pc. We also identify a depolarized halo around the H II region RCW 94, which we suggest results from the interaction of the H II region with a surrounding molecular cloud.},

The observations are challenging, though, because of the low expected signal strength (~10mK), and contamination by strong (>100K) foreground synchrotron emission in the Milky Way and extragalactic continuum sources. If reionization happened rapidly, there should be a characteristic signature visible against the smooth foreground in an all-sky spectrum. Here we report an all-sky spectrum between 100 and 200MHz, corresponding to the redshift range 6<z<13 for the 21-centimetre line. The data exclude a rapid reionization timescale of Δz<0.06 at the 95% confidence level.},

title = {Observations of cosmic reionization using the 21cm line of neutral Hydrogen},
abstract = {The epoch of reionization (EoR) sets a fundamental benchmark in cosmic structure formation, corresponding to the formation of the first luminous objects that act to ionize the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). Recent observations of Gunn-Peterson absorption toward the highest redshift QSOs, plus studies of large scale CMB polarization, and of z > 6 galaxy populations, among others, imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z ≥ 6. However, each of these techniques is limited in its diagnostic capabilities. Observing the HI 21cm line from the neutral IGM prior to, and during, cosmic reionization is the most direct probe of this key, and as yet barely explored, phase of cosmic evolution. The HI 21cm signal depends on a number of physical parameters, including the excitation temperature, large scale structure (density fluctuations), and the ionization fraction (the `bubble machine'), and HI 21cm studies have been called the `richest of all cosmological data sets.' Potential observations include: (i) studies of small to intermediate scale structures in the IGM through HI 21cm absorption toward the first radio loud AGN and GRBs, (ii) studies of the power spectrum of fluctuations in the HI due to density and ionization structure, and (iii) ultimately, direct `tomography' of the large scale structure of the neutral IGM using the SKA. I summarize predictions for the HI 21cm signals, then consider capabilities of facilities being built, or planned, to detect these signals. I also discuss the significant observational challenges when observing at these low frequencies (< 200 MHz).},

title = {Redshifted 21 cm Emission from Minihalos before Reionization},
abstract = {Before reionization, the intergalactic medium (IGM) may have been sufficiently cold for low-mass ``minihalos'' to condense out of the gas and subsequently affect reionization. Previous work has shown that minihalos generate reasonably large 21 cm fluctuations. Here we consider this signal in its proper cosmological context and show that isolating minihalos from the rest of the IGM is extremely difficult. Using the well-known halo model, we compute the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from minihalos and show that the signal decreases rapidly as feedback increases the Jeans mass. We then show that even a small Lyα background increases the 21 cm fluctuations of the diffuse IGM well beyond those of the minihalos; because the mass fraction in the IGM is much larger, minihalos will lie buried within the IGM signal. The distinctive signatures of nonlinear bias and minihalo structure emerge only at much smaller scales, well beyond the resolution of any upcoming instrument. Using simple but representative reionization histories, we then show that the required Lyα background level is most likely achieved at z>~15, while minihalos are still rare, so that they are almost always degenerate with the diffuse IGM.},

abstract = {The contribution of the unresolved extragalactic radio sources to the diffuse brightness of the sky was evaluated using the source number-flux measurements available in literature. We first optimized the fitting function of the data based on the number counts' distribution. We then computed the brightness temperature at various frequencies from 151 to 8440 MHz and derived its spectral dependence. As expected the frequency dependence can be described by a power law with a spectral index γ~=-2.7, in agreement with the flux emitted by the steep-spectrum sources. The contribution of flat-spectrum sources becomes relevant at frequencies above several GHz. Using the data available in the literature we improved our knowledge of the brightness of the unresolved extragalactic radio sources. The results obtained have general validity and can be used to disentangle the various contributions of the sky brightness and to evaluate the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature.},

title = {The large-scale HI structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud},
abstract = {We combine new Parkes telescope observations of neutral hydrogen (Hi) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with an Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) aperture synthesis mosaic to obtain a set of images sensitive to all angular (spatial) scales between 98 arcsec (30 pc) and 4 deg (4 kpc). The new data are used to study the HI spatial power spectrum over a range of contiguous scale sizes wider than those previously achieved in any other galaxy, including our own. The spatial power spectrum closely obeys the relation P(k) ~ k^gamma, with gamma =-3.04 +/- 0.02, similar to values obtained by other authors for our own Galaxy which are in the range gamma =-3.0 to -2.8. This is surprising given the very different morphology, gas-richness, star-formation rate and evolution of the two systems, and may imply similar mechanisms for structure formation. One interpretation of the P(k) power-law is that the interstellar medium (ISM) of the SMC is fractal in nature, consisting of a hierarchy of HI cloud structures created, for example, by homogeneous turbulence. The projected fractal dimension of D_p=1.5 is similar to values obtained by other authors for molecular clouds in the Galaxy in the size range ~ 0.05 to 100 pc. Such a model is consistent with a low space-filling factor for the neutral gas. A kinematic study of the HI data reveals the existence of three supergiant shells which were previously undetectable in the ATCA data alone. These shells have diameters up to 1.8 kpc and require energies (in the standard supernova-driven models) up to 2x10^54 erg. The structure and evolution of the ISM in the SMC are heavily influenced by the formation of these supergiant shells.},

The survey has a 15.6 arcmin angular resolution and achieves a noise level of 15 mJy beam-1. We demonstrate a novel interferometric data analysis that involves calibration of drift scan data, integration through the co-addition of warped snapshot images, and deconvolution of the point-spread function through forward modeling. We present a point source catalog down to a flux limit of 4 Jy. We detect polarization from only one of the sources, PMN J0351-2744, at a level of 1.8% $\pm$ 0.4%, whereas the remaining sources have a polarization fraction below 2%. Compared to a reported average value of 7% at 1.4 GHz, the polarization fraction of compact sources significantly decreases at low frequencies. We find a wealth of diffuse polarized emission across a large area of the survey with a maximum peak of ~13 K, primarily with positive rotation measure values smaller than +10 rad m-2. The small values observed indicate that the emission is likely to have a local origin (closer than a few hundred parsecs). There is a large sky area at α >= 2h30m where the diffuse polarized emission rms is fainter than 1 K. Within this area of low Galactic polarization we characterize the foreground properties in a cold sky patch at (α, δ) = (4h, -27.$\,^{\circ}$6) in terms of three-dimensional power spectra.},

abstract = {Primordial stars are likely to be very massive, form in isolation, and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark matter halos. Such early black holes, could be the seed black holes for the many supermassive black holes found in galaxies in the local universe. If they exist, their mergers with nearby supermassive black holes may be a prime signal for long wavelength gravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation of black holes in the center of high redshift dark matter halos and explore implications of initial natal kick velocities conjectured by some formation models. The central concentration of early black holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they are born even with moderate kicks of tens of km/s. The modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the lower mass black holes as compared to those still embedded in their parent halos. Therefore, merger rates may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N body simulations we quantify the role of natal kicks of black holes formed from massive metal free stars on their merger rates with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies. Our results also apply to black holes ejected by the gravitational slingshot mechanism.

title = {What do observations of the Lyman-alpha fraction tell us about reionization?},
abstract = {An appealing approach for studying the reionization history of the universe is to measure the redshift evolution of the Lyman-alpha fraction, the percentage of Lyman-break selected galaxies that emit appreciably in the Ly-alpha line. This fraction is expected to fall-off towards high redshift as the intergalactic medium becomes significantly neutral, and the galaxies' Ly-alpha emission is progressively attenuated. Intriguingly, early measurements with this technique suggest a strong drop in the Ly-alpha fraction near z ~ 7. Previous work concluded that this requires a surprisingly neutral intergalactic medium -- with neutral hydrogen filling more than 50 % of the volume of the universe -- at this redshift. We model the evolving Ly-alpha fraction using cosmological simulations of the reionization process. Before reionization completes, the simulated Ly-alpha fraction has large spatial fluctuations owing to the inhomogeneity of reionization. Since existing measurements of the Ly-alpha fraction span relatively small regions on the sky, and sample these regions only sparsely, they may by chance probe mostly galaxies with above average Ly-alpha attenuation. We find that this sample variance is not exceedingly large for existing surveys, but that it does somewhat mitigate the required neutral fraction at z ~ 7. Quantitatively, in a fiducial model calibrated to match measurements after reionization, we find that current z = 7 observations require a volume-averaged neutral fraction of x_HI > 0.05 at 95 % confidence level. Hence, we find that the z ~ 7 Ly-alpha fraction measurements do likely probe the universe before reionization completes but that they do not require a very large neutral fraction.},

title = {Measurements of the ultraviolet background at 4.6 < z < 6.4 using the quasar proximity effect},
abstract = {We present measurements of the ionizing ultraviolet background (UVB) at z˜ 5-6 using the quasar proximity effect. The 15 quasars in our sample cover the range 4.6 < zq < 6.4, enabling the first proximity-effect measurements of the UVB at z > 5. The metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate, Γbkg, was determined by modelling the combined ionization field from the quasar and the UVB in the proximity zone on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The optical depths in the spectra were corrected for the expected effect of the quasar until the mean flux in the proximity region equalled that in the average Lyα forest, and from this we make a measurement of Γbkg. A number of systematic effects were tested using synthetic spectra. Noise in the flux was found to be the largest source of bias at z˜ 5, while uncertainties in the mean transmitted Lyα flux are responsible for the largest bias at z˜ 6. The impacts of large-scale overdensities and Lyman limit systems on Γbkgwere also investigated, but found to be small at z > 5. We find a decline in Γbkg with redshift, from log(Γbkg) =-12.15 $\pm$ 0.16 at z˜ 5 to log(Γbkg) =-12.84 $\pm$ 0.18 at z˜ 6 (1σ errors). Compared to UVB measurements at lower redshifts, our measurements suggest a drop of a factor of 5 in the H I photoionization rate between z˜ 4 and 6. The decline of Γbkg appears to be gradual, and we find no evidence for a sudden change in the UVB at any redshift that would indicate a rapid change in the attenuation length of ionizing photons. Combined with recent measurements of the evolution of the mean free path of ionizing photons, our results imply a decline in the emissivity of ionizing photons by roughly a factor of 2 from z˜ 5 to 6, albeit with significant uncertainty due to the measurement errors in both Γbkg and the mean free path. A part of the observations were made at the W. M. Keck Observatory which is operated as a scientific partnership between the California Institute of Technology and the University of California; it was made possible by the generous support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. This paper also includes data gathered with the 6.5-m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

title = {Developing A Low-frequency Interferometer For Detecting The Epoch Of Reionization: Correlation, Calibration, And High Dynamic-range Imaging With Paper},
abstract = {The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) is a low-frequency interferometer being developed to detect cosmic reionization via fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen in the early intergalactic medium. Interfering with the direct detection of a global reionization signature are a myriad of astrophysical foregrounds, including polarized galactic synchrotron emission, continuum point-sources, and galactic/extra-galactic free-free emission. Suppression of these foregrounds will require extraordinary calibration and high dynamic-range imaging, as well as large numbers of antennas to achieve the necessary sensitivity in the region of the power spectrum where the reionization signal peaks relative to them. Addressing the challenge of correlating large numbers of antennas, we have developed a flexible correlator architecture that scales to hundreds of antennas. This correlator is based on Field-Programmable Gate Array processors connected by a 10 Gb Ethernet switch, and programmed using a parameterized signal processing library. We demonstrate how this work has dramatically decreased correlator development time, and has enabled PAPER to grow as a series of deployments of increasing size. Calibration and high dynamic-range imaging with low-frequency interferometers are exacerbated by wide bandwidths and large fields-of-view (FoV). To simplify the calibration process when an interferometer consistently has many strong sources simultaneously in its FoV, we present a fringe-rate/delay filtering technique to isolating source fluxes. This is implemented as part of Astronomical Interferometry in PYthon (AIPY), a new open-source software toolkit that facilitates exploration and algorithm development by modularizing data processing and visibility simulation. We present the application of this toolkit to various aspects of PAPER calibration. Finally, we present the first all-sky map and point source catalog derived from 100-200MHz observations by 4, 8, and 16 antenna PAPER deployments in Green Bank, WV, and in western Australia.},

title = {On the Direct Detectability of the Cosmic Dark Ages: 21 Centimeter Emission from Minihalos},
abstract = {In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) theory of structure formation, virialized minihalos (with Tvir<~104 K) form in abundance at high redshift (z>6), during the cosmic ``dark ages.'' The hydrogen in these minihalos, the first nonlinear baryonic structures to form in the universe, is mostly neutral and sufficiently hot and dense to emit strongly at the 21 cm line. We calculate the emission from individual minihalos and the radiation background contributed by their combined effect. Minihalos create a ``21 cm forest'' of emission lines. We predict that the angular fluctuations in this 21 cm background should be detectable with the planned Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and Square Kilometer Array (SKA), thus providing a direct probe of structure formation during the dark ages. Such a detection will serve to confirm the basic CDM paradigm while constraining the shape of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations down to much smaller scales than have previously been constrained, the onset and duration of the reionization epoch, and the conditions that led to the first stars and quasars. We present results here for the currently favored, flat ΛCDM model, for different tilts of the primordial power spectrum.},

Accurate proper motions and brightness changes are presented for 342 distinct radio peaks, ranging in angular size from 1 arcmin for fragments of the intense ring of emission to less than the beam size of 2.0 arcsec x 2.3 arcsec for compact structure. The radio peaks are moving systematically away from a point offset by 2.1 arcsec N, 14.9 arcsec W from the expansion center of the fast optical filaments. The time scale for the expansion of both compact and broad scale radio structure is confirmed to be three times that of the fast optical filaments, and several intense compact radio peaks situated near the periphery of the radio plateau have individual outward motions significantly slower than is predicted for swept-up matter downstream of a blast wave propagating in a uniform external medium. Proper motions are independent of the sign of brightness changes. Unlike the fast optical filaments, the radio peaks have nonsystematic components of motion of typically 0.1 arcsec/yr which are not due to measurement errors or changes in shape.},

title = {The 21-cm forest},
abstract = {We examine the prospects for studying the pre-reionization intergalactic medium (IGM) through the so-called 21-cm forest in spectra of bright high-redshift radio sources. We first compute the evolution of the mean optical depth τ for models that include X-ray heating of the IGM gas, Wouthuysen-Field coupling, and reionization. Under most circumstances, the spin temperature TS grows large well before reionization begins in earnest; this occurs so long as the X-ray luminosity of high-redshift starbursts (per unit star formation rate) is comparable to that in nearby galaxies. As a result, τ <~ 10-3 throughout most of reionization, and background sources must sit well beyond the reionization surface in order to experience absorption that is measurable by square-kilometre class telescopes. HII regions produce relatively large `transmission gaps' and may therefore still be observable during the early stages of reionization. Absorption from sheets and filaments in the cosmic web fades once TS becomes large and should be rare during reionization. Minihaloes can produce strong (albeit narrow) absorption features. Measuring their abundance would yield useful limits on the strength of feedback processes in the IGM as well as their effect on reionization.},

The seeds of the local SMBHs are assumed to be 'pregalactic' black holes, remnants of the first POPIII stars. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center owing to dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. A simple model in which the damage done to a stellar cusps by decaying BH pairs is cumulative is able to reproduce the observed scaling relation between galaxy luminosity and core size. An accretion model connecting quasar activity with major mergers and the observed BH mass-velocity dispersion correlation reproduces remarkably well the observed luminosity function of optically-selected quasars in the redshift range 1<z<5. We finally asses the potential observability of the gravitational wave background generated by the cosmic evolution of SMBH binaries by the planned space-born interferometer LISA.},

abstract = {We discuss the prospects for ``tomography'' of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts using the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen. Existing observational constraints on the epoch of reionization imply a complex ionization history that may require multiple generations of sources. The 21 cm transition provides a unique tool to probe this era in detail, because it does not suffer from saturation effects, retains full redshift information, and directly probes the IGM gas. Observations in the redshifted 21 cm line will allow one to study the history and morphology of reionization in detail. Depending on the characteristics of the first sources, they may also allow us to probe the era before reionization, when the first structures and luminous sources were forming. The construction of high signal-to-noise ratio maps on arcmin scales will require approximately one square kilometer of collecting area.},

title = {Foreground Contamination in Interferometric Measurements of the Redshifted 21 cm Power Spectrum},
abstract = {Subtraction of astrophysical foreground contamination from "dirty" sky maps produced by simulated measurements of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has been performed by fitting a 3rd-order polynomial along the spectral dimension of each pixel in the data cubes. The simulations are the first to include the unavoidable instrumental effects of the frequency-dependent primary antenna beams and synthesized array beams. They recover the one-dimensional spherically-binned input redshifted 21 cm power spectrum to within approximately 1% over the scales probed most sensitively by the MWA (0.01 < k < 1 Mpc^-1) and demonstrate that realistic instrumental effects will not mask the EoR signal. We find that the weighting function used to produce the dirty sky maps from the gridded visibility measurements is important to the success of the technique. Uniform weighting of the visibility measurements produces the best results, whereas natural weighting significantly worsens the foreground subtraction by coupling structure in the density of the visibility measurements to spectral structure in the dirty sky map data cube. The extremely dense uv-coverage of the MWA was found to be advantageous for this technique and produced very good results on scales corresponding to |u| < 500 wavelengths in the uv-plane without any selective editing of the uv-coverage.},

abstract = {We present an overview of the ongoing VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS). The VLSS will map an area of 9.1 sr covering the entire sky above a declination of -30 degrees (or 75% of the full sky) at a frequency of 74 MHz (4 meter wavelength), with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and resolution at this low frequency. The observations are now roughly 95% complete. The observational challenges at this wavelength include radio-frequency interference (RFI), ionospheric phase distortions and a large field of view filled with sources. These challenges have been surmounted by a variety of new algorithms. The principal data products from the survey will be a set of publicly available images along with a source catalog of approximately 80,000 objects. Thus we will create an online virtual observatory at this previously unexplored frequency which will complement other major surveys at higher frequencies such as the NVSS. From these data, statistically useful samples of extragalactic and Galactic objects, such as high-redshift radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, supernova remnants and pulsars can be assembled for further study. In addition, this survey will provide a crucial calibration grid for use with the next-generation of large low frequency telescopes such as the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) and Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). Current data products and more information are available on our website http://lwa.nrl.navy.mil/VLSS.},

title = {Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Polarization Analysis},
abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) has mapped the entire sky in five frequency bands between 23 and 94 GHz with polarization-sensitive radiometers. We present 3 year full-sky maps of the polarization and analyze them for foreground emission and cosmological implications. These observations open up a new window for understanding how the universe began and help set a foundation for future observations. WMAP observes significant levels of polarized foreground emission due to both Galactic synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission. Synchrotron radiation is the dominant signal at l<50 and ν<~40 GHz, while thermal dust emission is evident at 94 GHz. The least contaminated channel is at 61 GHz. We present a model of polarized foreground emission that captures the large angular scale characteristics of the microwave sky. After applying a Galactic mask that cuts 25.7% of the sky, we show that the high Galactic latitude rms polarized foreground emission, averaged over l=4-6, ranges from ~5 μK at 22 GHz to <~0.6 μK at 61 GHz. By comparison, the levels of intrinsic CMB polarization for a ΛCDM model with an optical depth of τ=0.09 and assumed tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.3 are ~0.3 μK for E-mode polarization and ~0.1 μK for B-mode polarization. To analyze the maps for CMB polarization at l<16, we subtract a model of the foreground emission that is based primarily on a scaling WMAP's 23 GHz map. In the foreground-corrected maps, we detect l(l+1)CEEl=<2-6>/2π=0.086+/-0.029 (μK)2. This is interpreted as the result of rescattering of the CMB by free electrons released during reionization at zr=10.9+2.7-2.3 for a model with instantaneous reionization. By computing the likelihood of just the EE data as a function of τ we find τ=0.10+/-0.03. When the same EE data are used in the full six-parameter fit to all WMAP data (TT, TE, EE), we find τ=0.09+/-0.03. Marginalization over the foreground subtraction affects this value by δτ<0.01. We see no evidence for B modes, limiting them to l(l+1)CBBl=<2-6>/2π=-0.04+/-0.03 (μK)2. We perform a template fit to the E-mode and B-mode data with an approximate model for the tensor scalar ratio. We find that the limit from the polarization signals alone is r<2.2 (95% CL), where r is evaluated at k=0.002 Mpc-1. This corresponds to a limit on the cosmic density of gravitational waves of ΩGWh2<5×10-12. From the full WMAP analysis, we find r<0.55 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit of ΩGWh2<1×10-12 (95% CL). The limit on r is approaching the upper bound of predictions for some of the simplest models of inflation, r~0.3.},

title = {Radio Astronomical Probes of Cosmic Reionization},
abstract = {The epoch of reionization (EoR) corresponds to a 'cosmic phase transition', when the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes ionized by the first stars and/or AGN. While the discoveries of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs in the spectra of the highest redshift QSOs, and large scale polarization of the CMB, have set the first constraints on the EoR, the process of reionization, and the nature of the first luminous objects, remain two of the paramount questions in cosmic structure formation. Moreover, the GP effect is such that observations of this epoch will be difficult at wavelengths shorter than about 1 micron. In this talk I will explore studies of the EoR at meter through millimeter wavelengths. I will present recent observations of the dust, molecular gas, and star formation activity in the host galaxies of the highest redshift QSOs (z > 6). These results have interesting implications on the timescale for metal and dust enrichment, on the possibility of co-eval formation of SMBHs and galaxies, and on the process of reionization. I will then discuss future capabilities of low frequency radio astronomy to study the neutral IGM via the HI 21cm line, including imaging and power spectral analyses of large scale structure in emission, and absorption studies toward the first radio loud sources.},

The volume, mass resolution and output frequency make the Millennium Simulation a unique resource for the study of the hierarchical growth of structure. We construct the merger trees of present-day friends-of-friends groups and calculate a variety of statistics that quantify the masses of their progenitors as a function of redshift, accretion rates, and the redshift distribution of their most recent major merger. We also look in the forward direction and quantify the present-day mass distribution of haloes into which high-redshift progenitors of a specific mass become incorporated. We find that the EPS formalism and its Monte Carlo extension capture the qualitative behaviour of all these statistics, but as redshift increases they systematically underestimate the masses of the most massive progenitors. This shortcoming is worst for the Monte Carlo algorithm. We present a fitting function to a scaled version of the progenitor mass distribution and show how it can be used to make more accurate predictions of both progenitor and final halo mass distributions.},

title = {Realistic simulations of the Galactic polarized foreground: consequences for 21-cm reionization detection experiments},
abstract = {Experiments designed to measure the redshifted 21-cm line from the epoch of reionization (EoR) are challenged by strong astrophysical foreground contamination, ionospheric distortions, complex instrumental response and other different types of noise (e.g. radio frequency interference). The astrophysical foregrounds are dominated by diffuse synchrotron emission from our Galaxy. Here we present a simulation of the Galactic emission used as a foreground module for the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-EoR key science project end-to-end simulations. The simulation produces total and polarized intensity over 10$\,^{\circ}$× 10$\,^{\circ}$ maps of the Galactic synchrotron and free-free emission, including all observed characteristics of the emission: spatial fluctuations of amplitude and spectral index of the synchrotron emission, together with Faraday rotation effects. The importance of these simulations arises from the fact that the Galactic polarized emission could behave in a manner similar to the EoR signal along the frequency direction. As a consequence, an improper instrumental calibration will give rise to leakages of the polarized to the total signal and mask the desired EoR signal. In this paper, we address this for the first time through realistic simulations.},

abstract = {We construct a catalog of radio sources detected by the Green Bank 6 cm survey GB6, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) (20 cm), and Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) (92 cm) radio surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical survey. The 2.7 million entries in the publicly-available master catalog are comprised of the closest three FIRST to NVSS matches (within 30'') and vice versa, and unmatched sources from each survey. Entries are supplemented by data from the other radio and optical surveys, where available. All objects with even a small probability of physical association are included, such that catalog users can easily implement their own selection criteria for data analysis. We perform data analysis in the ~ 3000 deg2 region of sky where the surveys overlap, which contains 140,000 NVSS-FIRST sources, of which 64,000 are detected by WENSS and 12,000 by GB6. About one third of each sample is detected by the SDSS. An automated classification method based on 20 cm fluxes defines three radio morphology classes: complex, resolved, and compact. Radio color-magnitude-morphology diagrams for these classes show structure suggestive of strong underlying physical correlations. Complex and resolved sources tend to have a steep spectral slope (α ~ -0.8) that is nearly constant from 6 to 92 cm, while the compact class (unresolved on ~5'' scale by FIRST) contains a significant number of flat-spectrum (α ~ 0) sources. In the optically-detected sample, quasars dominate the flat-spectrum compact sources while steep-spectrum and resolved objects contain substantial numbers of both quasars and galaxies. Differential radio counts of quasars and galaxies are similar at bright flux levels (>100 mJy at 20 cm), while at fainter levels the quasar counts are significantly reduced below galaxy counts. The optically-undetected sample is strongly biased toward steep-spectrum sources. In samples of quasars and galaxies with SDSS spectra (2885 and 1288 respectively), we find that radio properties such as spectral slope, morphology, and radio loudness are correlated with optical color and luminosity.},

abstract = {A number of radio interferometers are currently being planned or constructed to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not only will such measurements provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also traces the distribution of matter in the universe, this signal can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three-dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three-dimensional 21 cm power spectrum. We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. Next, we consider three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the velocity field fluctuations in the signal, and (3) looking at the signal at large enough scales that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a 2 yr observation with the second-generation interferometer MWA5000 in combination with the CMB telescope Planck could improve constraints on Ωw, Ωmh2, Ωbh2, Ων, ns, and αs. If the universe is substantially ionized by z~12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological parameters with any of the considered methods.},

title = {Simulations and Analytic Calculations of Bubble Growth during Hydrogen Reionization},
abstract = {We present results from a large volume simulation of hydrogen reionization. We combine 3D radiative transfer calculations and an N-body simulation, describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the growth of H II regions around high-redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks 10243 dark matter particles, in a box of comoving side length 65.6 Mpc h-1. This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of H II regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: H II regions grow collectively around highly clustered sources and have a well-defined characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of reionization to R>10 Mpc toward the end. We present a detailed statistical description of our results and compare them with a numerical scheme based on the analytic model by Furlanetto and coworkers. We find that the analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of H II regions and the 21 cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small-scale structure than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast numerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm surveys and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.},

title = {Host galaxies and the unification of radio-loud AGN},
abstract = {Our HST WFPC2 survey of 110 BL Lac objects, from six complete X-ray-, radio-, and optically-selected catalogs, probes the host galaxies of low-luminosity radio sources in the redshift range 0<z<1.35. The host galaxies are luminous ellipticals, well matched in radio power and galaxy magnitude to FR I radio galaxies. Similarly, the host galaxies of high luminosity quasars occupy the same region of this plane as FR II radio galaxies (matched in redshift). This strongly supports the unification of radio-loud AGN, and suggests that studying blazars at high redshift is a proxy for investigating less luminous (to us) but intrinsically identical radio galaxies, which are harder to find at high z. Accordingly, the difference between low-power jets in BL Lac objects and high-power jets in quasars can then be related to the FR I/FR II dichotomy; and the evolution of blazar host galaxies or their nuclei (jets) should correspond to the evolution of radio galaxies.},

abstract = {The accurate and precise removal of 21-cm foregrounds from Epoch of Reionization (EoR) redshifted 21-cm emission data is essential if we are to gain insight into an unexplored cosmological era. We apply a non-parametric technique, Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (gmca), to simulated Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-EoR data and show that it has the ability to clean the foregrounds with high accuracy. We recover the 21-cm 1D, 2D and 3D power spectra with high accuracy across an impressive range of frequencies and scales. We show that gmca preserves the 21-cm phase information, especially when the smallest spatial scale data is discarded. While it has been shown that LOFAR-EoR image recovery is theoretically possible using image smoothing, we add that wavelet decomposition is an efficient way of recovering 21-cm signal maps to the same or greater order of accuracy with more flexibility. By comparing the gmca output residual maps (equal to the noise, 21-cm signal and any foreground fitting errors) with the 21-cm maps at one frequency and discarding the smaller wavelet scale information, we find a correlation coefficient of 0.689, compared to 0.588 for the equivalently smoothed image. Considering only the pixels in a central patch covering 50 per cent of the total map area, these coefficients improve to 0.905 and 0.605, respectively, and we conclude that wavelet decomposition is a significantly more powerful method to denoise reconstructed 21-cm maps than smoothing.},

Our observations provide a unique opportunity to investigate the velocity structure, elemental abundances, and physical conditions within the Bridge gas, which until this time has remained unexplored. We compare the results obtained with information for the LMC and SMC, to test the theory that the Bridge gas originated in the SMC.

title = {LISA Data Analysis using MCMC methods},
abstract = { The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to simultaneously detect many thousands of low frequency gravitational wave signals. This presents a data analysis challenge that is very different to the one encountered in ground based gravitational wave astronomy. LISA data analysis requires the identification of individual signals from a data stream containing an unknown number of overlapping signals. Because of the signal overlaps, a global fit to all the signals has to be performed in order to avoid biasing the solution. However, performing such a global fit requires the exploration of an enormous parameter space with a dimension upwards of 50,000. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods offer a very promising solution to the LISA data analysis problem. MCMC algorithms are able to efficiently explore large parameter spaces, simultaneously providing parameter estimates, error analyses and even model selection. Here we present the first application of MCMC methods to simulated LISA data and demonstrate the great potential of the MCMC approach. Our implementation uses a generalized F-statistic to evaluate the likelihoods, and simulated annealing to speed convergence of the Markov chains. As a final step we super-cool the chains to extract maximum likelihood estimates, and estimates of the Bayes factors for competing models. We find that the MCMC approach is able to correctly identify the number of signals present, extract the source parameters, and return error estimates consistent with Fisher information matrix predictions. },

abstract = {Observations of the frequency dependence of the global brightness temperature of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen may be possible with single dipole experiments. In this paper, we develop a Fisher matrix formalism for calculating the sensitivity of such instruments to the 21 cm signal from reionization and the dark ages. We show that rapid reionization histories with duration Δz≲2 can be constrained, provided that local foregrounds can be well modeled by low order polynomials. It is then shown that observations in the range ν=50-100MHz can feasibly constrain the Lyα and x-ray emissivity of the first stars forming at z˜15-25, provided that systematic temperature residuals can be controlled to less than 1 mK. Finally, we demonstrate the difficulty of detecting the 21 cm signal from the dark ages before star formation.},

title = {Foregrounds for 21-cm observations of neutral gas at high redshift},
abstract = {We investigate a number of potential foregrounds for an ambitious goal of future radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR): spatial tomography of neutral gas at high redshift in 21-cm emission. While the expected temperature fluctuations due to unresolved radio point sources is highly uncertain, we point out that free-free emission from the ionizing haloes that reionized the Universe should define a minimal bound. This emission is likely to swamp the expected brightness temperature fluctuations, making proposed detections of the angular patchwork of 21-cm emission across the sky unlikely to be viable. Hα observations with JWST could place an upper bound on the contribution of high-redshift sources to the free-free background. An alternative approach is to discern the topology of reionization from spectral features due to 21-cm emission along a pencil-beam slice. This requires tight control of the frequency-dependence of the beam in order to prevent foreground sources from contributing excessive variance. We also investigate potential contamination by galactic and extragalactic radio recombination lines (RRLs). These are unlikely to be show-stoppers, although little is known about the distribution of RRLs away from the Galactic plane. The mini-halo emission signal is always less than that of the intergalactic medium (IGM), making mini-haloes unlikely to be detectable. If they are seen, it will be only in the very earliest stages of structure formation at high redshift, when the spin temperature of the IGM has not yet decoupled from the cosmic microwave background.},

abstract = { This paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of WMAP data alone. A simple LCDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic parameters of the model are consistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: Omega_b h^2 = 0.02273+-0.00062, Omega_c h^2 = 0.1099+-0.0062, Omega_L = 0.742+-0.030, n_s = 0.963+0.014- 0.015, tau = 0.087+-0.017, sigma_8 = 0.796+-0.036. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, tau>0, at 5 sigma significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z_reion = 11.0+-1.4 with 68% confidence. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z=6 at more than 3.5 sigma significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to foreground treatment of tau~0.01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale CMB data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We find evidence for the first time in the CMB power spectrum for a non-zero cosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with the standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit LCDM model with N_eff=0 at >99.5% confidence, and N_eff > 2.3 (95% CL) when varied. The five-year WMAP data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r < 0.43 (95% CL), for power-law models. With longer integration we find no evidence for a running spectral index, with dn_s/dlnk = -0.037+-0.028. },

title = {The Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies Survey: Constraints on the Bright End of the z ~ 8 Luminosity Function},
abstract = {We report the discovery of 33 Lyman-break galaxy candidates at z ~ 8 detected in Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) pure-parallel survey. The ongoing BoRG survey currently has the largest area (274 arcmin2) with Y 098 (or Y 105), J 125, and H 160 band coverage needed to search for z ~ 8 galaxies, about three times the current CANDELS area, and slightly larger than what will be the final CANDELS wide component with Y 105 data (required to select z ~ 8 sources). Our sample of 33 relatively bright Y 098-dropout galaxies have J 125-band magnitudes between 25.5 and 27.4 mag. This is the largest sample of bright (J 125 <~ 27.4) z ~ 8 galaxy candidates presented to date. Combining our data set with the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field data set, we constrain the rest-frame ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at z ~ 8 over the widest dynamic range currently available. The combined data sets are well fitted by a Schechter function, i.e., \phi (L) = \phi _{*} (L/L_{*})^{\alpha }\ e^{-(L/L_{*})}, without evidence for an excess of sources at the bright end. At 68% confidence, for h = 0.7 we derive phi* = (4.3+3.5 -2.1) × 10-4 Mpc-3, M * = -20.26+0.29 -0.34, and a very steep faint-end slope α = -1.98+0.23 -0.22. While the best-fit parameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between phi* and M *, our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of the faint-end power-law slope at z ~ 8 compared to the best previous determination at $\pm$0.4. With a future expansion of the BoRG survey, combined with planned ultradeep WFC3/IR observations, it will be possible to further reduce this uncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slope compared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key role played by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

title = {Simulating Cosmic Reionization},
abstract = {The Cosmic Dark Ages and the Epoch of Reionization constitute a crucial missing link in our understanding of the evolution of the intergalactic medium and the formation and evolution of galaxies. Due to the complex nature of this global process it is best studied through large-scale numerical simulations. This presents considerable computational challenges. The dominant contributors of ionizing radiation were dwarf galaxies. These tiny galaxies must be resolved in very large cosmological volumes in order to derive their clustering properties and the corresponding observational signatures correctly, which makes this one of the most challenging problems of numerical cosmology. We have recently performed the largest and most detailed simulations of the formation of early cosmological large-scale structures and their radiative feedback leading to cosmic reionization. This was achieved by running extremely large (up to 29 billion-particle) N-body simulations of the formation of the Cosmic Web, with enough particles and sufficient force resolution to resolve all the galactic halos with total masses larger than 10^8 Solar masses in computational volumes of up to (163 Mpc)^3. These results were then post-processed by propagating the ionizing radiation from all sources by using fast and accurate ray-tracing radiative transfer method. Both of our codes are parallelized using a combination of MPI and OpenMP and to this date have been run efficiently on up to 2048 cores (N-body) and up to 10000 cores (radiative transfer) on the newly-deployed Sun Constellation Linux Cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. In this paper we describe our codes, parallelization strategies, scaling and some preliminary scientific results. (abridged)},

title = {The Slope of the Black Hole Mass versus Velocity Dispersion Correlation},
abstract = {Observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the mass of the central dark object MBH and the velocity dispersion σ of the host galaxy, of the form log(MBH/Msolar)=α+βlog(σ/ σ0) however, published estimates of the slope β span a wide range (3.75-5.3). Merritt {\&} Ferrarese have argued that low slopes (<~4) arise because of neglect of random measurement errors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations and several others account for at most a small part of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for the same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we suggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese {\&} Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to re/8 (re is the effective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from dispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. A new determination of the slope using 31 galaxies yields β=4.02+/-0.32, α=8.13+/-0.06 for σ0=200 km s-1. The MBH-σ relation has an intrinsic dispersion in logMBH that is no larger than 0.25-0.3 dex and may be smaller if observational errors have been underestimated. In an appendix, we present a simple kinematic model for the velocity-dispersion profile of the Galactic bulge.},

abstract = {The 21 cm line provides a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology at high redshifts, but unlocking the potential of this probe requires the robust mitigation of foreground contaminants that are typically several orders of magnitude brighter than the cosmological signal. Recent simulations and observations have shown that the smooth spectral structure of foregrounds combines with instrument chromaticity to contaminate a "wedge"-shaped region in cylindrical Fourier space. While previous efforts have explored the suppression of foregrounds within this wedge, as well as the avoidance of this highly contaminated region, all such efforts have neglected a rigorous examination of the error statistics associated with the wedge. Using a quadratic estimator formalism applied to the interferometric measurement equation, we provide a framework for such a rigorous analysis (incorporating a fully covariant treatment of errors), and find that there are strong error correlations throughout the wedge that have so far been neglected in sensitivity derivations. These error correlations substantially degrade the sensitivity of arrays relying on contributions from long baselines, compared to what one would estimate assuming uncorrelated errors.},

title = {The imprint of massive black hole formation models on the LISA data stream},
abstract = {The formation, merging and accretion history of massive black holes (MBHs) along the hierarchical build-up of cosmic structures leaves a unique imprint on the background of gravitational waves (GWs) at mHz frequencies. We study here, by means of dedicated simulations of black hole build-up, the possibility of constraining different models of black hole cosmic evolution using future GW space-borne missions, such as LISA. We consider two main scenarios for black hole formation, namely, one where seeds are light (~=102Msolar, remnant of Population III stars) and one where seeds are heavy (>~104Msolar, direct collapse). In all the models we have investigated, MBH binary coalescences do not produce a stochastic GW background, but rather, a set of individual resolved events. Detection of several hundreds merging events in a 3-yr LISA mission will be the sign of a heavy seed scenario with efficient formation of black hole seeds in a large fraction of high-redshift haloes. At the other extreme, a low event rate, about a few tens in 3 yr, is peculiar of scenarios where either the seeds are light, and many coalescences do not fall into the LISA band, or seeds are massive, but rare. In this case a decisive diagnostic is provided by the shape of the mass distribution of detected events. Light binaries (m < 104Msolar) are predicted in a fairly large number in Population III remnant models, but are totally absent in direct collapse models. Finally, a further, helpful diagnostic of black hole formation models lies in the distribution of the mass ratios in binary coalescences. While heavy seed models predict that most of the detected events involve equal-mass binaries, in the case of light seeds, mass ratios are equally distributed in the range 0.1-1.},

title = {The LOFAR EoR Data Model: (I) Effects of Noise and Instrumental Corruptions on the 21-cm Reionization Signal-Extraction Strategy},
abstract = {A number of experiments are set to measure the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The common denominator of these experiments are the large data sets produced, contaminated by various instrumental effects, ionospheric distortions, RFI and strong Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the Data Model that will be the basis of the signal analysis for the LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) EoR Key Science Project (LOFAR EoR KSP). Using this data model we simulate realistic visibility data sets over a wide frequency band, taking properly into account all currently known instrumental corruptions (e.g. direction-dependent gains, complex gains, polarization effects, noise, etc). We then apply primary calibration errors to the data in a statistical sense, assuming that the calibration errors are random Gaussian variates at a level consistent with our current knowledge based on observations with the LOFAR Core Station 1. Our aim is to demonstrate how the systematics of an interferometric measurement affect the quality of the calibrated data, how errors correlate and propagate, and in the long run how this can lead to new calibration strategies. We present results of these simulations and the inversion process and extraction procedure. We also discuss some general properties of the coherency matrix and Jones formalism that might prove useful in solving the calibration problem of aperture synthesis arrays. We conclude that even in the presence of realistic noise and instrumental errors, the statistical signature of the EoR signal can be detected by LOFAR with relatively small errors. A detailed study of the statistical properties of our data model and more complex instrumental models will be considered in the future.},

title = {Probing the Dark Ages with the Square Kilometer Array},
abstract = {The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will be one of a suite of new, large telescopes for the 21st century probing fundamental physics, the origin and evolution of the Universe, the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the formation and distribution of planets. The epoch of reionization (EoR) sets a fundamental benchmark in cosmic structure formation, corresponding to the formation of the first luminous objects that ionize the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). Recent observations at near-IR and radio wavelengths imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z > 6. The SKA will provide critical insight into the EoR in a number of ways (for a review, see Carilli et al. 2004, NewAR, 48, 1029). First, the ability of the SKA to image the neutral IGM in 21cm emission is a truly unique probe of the process of reionization and is recognized as the next necessary and fundamental step in our study of the evolution of large scale structure and cosmic reionization. Second, study of HI 21cm absorption toward the first radio loud objects probes small to intermediate scale structure in the neutral 'cosmic web', as well as HI in the first collapsed structures (proto-disks and mini-halos). And third, the incomparable sensitivity of the SKA allows for the study of the molecular gas, dust, and star formation activity in the first galaxies, as well as the radio continuum emission from the first accreting massive black holes. Such objects will be obscured at optical wavelengths due to absorption by the neutral IGM. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is operated by Associated Universities, Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.},

abstract = {Some orthodox notions concerning the structure and evolution of star-forming regions are challenged; it is proposed that they arise largely by a dual process in which conceptual models are fashioned after categories which are in great part reflections of observational limitations, and the models are projected onto interpretations of data. Several examples are discussed. The need for internal support of molecular clouds is questioned. It is suggested that the inverse density-size relation often claimed for clouds and accounted for by several theoretical models is an artifact caused by limited dynamic range column density detectability, selection bias, distance uncertainties, and internal density gradients, and is contradicted by several unbiased surveys. Column density structures mapped with a large spatial and column density dynamic range are found to be dominated by irregular, connected, and nested forms on all sides. These features and a technique for the quantification of the complex structure are illustrated with a densely-sampled column density image of the Taurus region constructed from IRAS data.},

title = {Low-frequency interferometry: Design, calibration, and analysis towards detecting the epoch of reionization},
abstract = {Low-frequency interferometry provides us with the possibility of directly observing, via red-shifted 21cm emission, the ionization of the primordial intergalactic medium by radiation from the first stars and black holes. Building such interferometers presents daunting technical challenges related to the cross-correlation, calibration, and analysis of data from large antenna arrays with wide fields-of-view in an observing band below 200 MHz. Addressing cross-correlation data processing, I present a general-purpose correlator architecture that uses standard 10-Gbit Ethernet switches to pass data between flexible hardware modules containing Field Programmable Gate Array chips. These chips are programmed using open-source signal processing libraries developed to be flexible, scalable, and chip-independent. This work reduces the time and cost of implementing a wide range of signal processing systems, and facilitates upgrading to new generations of processing technology. This correlator architecture is supporting the incremental build-out of the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization. Targeting calibration concerns, I present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines of wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select regions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The technique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra from a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional "delay images", and then the transformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional "delay/delayrate images." These filters are augmented by a one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been developed to compensate for data-excision effects related to the removal of radio frequency interference. This approach allows CLEANed, source-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain functions. These techniques are applied to PAPER data as a demonstration of their value in calibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide relative bandwidths and large fields-of-view. Finally, I describe PAPER's overall architecture and summarize two PAPER deployments: a 4-antenna array in of Western Australia and an 8-antenna array in Green Bank, WV. After reporting on system characterization and data analysis techniques, I present an all-sky map synthesized between 139 MHz and 174 MHz using data from both arrays that reaches down to 80 mJy (4.9 K, for a beam size of 2.15e-5 steradians at 154 MHz), with a 10 mJy (620 mK) thermal noise level that indicates what would be achievable with better foreground subtraction. I calculate angular power spectra (Cℓ) in a cold patch and determine them to be dominated by point sources. Although the sample variance of foregrounds dominates errors in these power spectra, I measure a thermal noise level of 310 mK at ℓ = 100 for a 1.46-MHz band centered at 164.5 MHz. This sensitivity level is approximately three orders of magnitude in temperature above the expected level of 21cm fluctuations associated with reionization.},

title = {A first direct measurement of the intergalactic medium temperature around a quasar at z = 6},
abstract = {The thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) provides an indirect probe of both the HI and HeII reionization epochs. Current constraints on the IGM temperature from the Lyα forest are restricted to the redshift range 2 <= z <= 4.5, limiting the ability to probe the thermal memory of HI reionization towards higher redshift. In this work, we present the first direct measurement of the IGM temperature around a z = 6 quasar by analyzing the Doppler widths of Lyα absorption lines in the proximity zone of SDSS J0818+1722. We use a high-resolution (R = 40000) Keck/HIRES spectrum in combination with detailed numerical modelling to obtain the temperature at mean density, T0 = 23600 +/- 50006900K (+/-92009300K) at 68 (95) per cent confidence assuming a prior probability following HI and HeII reionization. This enables us to place an upper limit on the redshift of HI reionization, zH, within 33 comoving Mpc of SDSS J0818+1722. If the quasar reionizes the HeII in its vicinity, then in the limit of instantaneous reionization we infer zH < 9.0(11.0) at 68 (95) per cent confidence assuming photoheating is the dominant heat source and that HI reionization is driven by ionizing sources with soft spectra, typical of Population II stars. If the HI and HeII in the IGM around SDSS J0818+1722 are instead reionized simultaneously by a population of massive metal-free stars, characterized by very hard ionizing spectra, we obtain a tighter upper limit of zH < 8.4(9.4). Initiating reionization at higher redshifts produces temperatures which are too low with respect to our constraint unless the HI ionizing sources or the quasar itself has spectra significantly harder than typically assumed.},

title = {High-redshift radio galaxies: at the crossroads},
abstract = {The next generation of surveys of extragalactic radio sources will be dominated by different types of objects than the jetted-AGN that dominate surveys like 3C, 6C and 7C. Before radio astronomy becomes concentrated on the new types of object, it is vital that we understand the cosmological importance of the jetted-AGN that have been studied for many years. I argue that, as observational manifestations of Eddington-tuned outflow events, these objects may have more significance for galaxy/cluster formation and evolution than is typically appreciated. Outstanding problems in galaxy formation may be solved by cosmological simulations in which this type of outflow, as well as other types associated with weaker jets, are properly taken into account. I will highlight areas of ignorance which are currently hindering attempts to do this.},

title = {How to Measure the Global Redshifted 21cm Signal},
abstract = {Making measurements of the highly-redshifted 21cm hyperfine transition of hydrogen is a potentially powerful way to constrain the Epoch of Reionization and the preceding Dark Ages. While experiments have traditionally focused on tomographic measurements, recently there has been a growing interest in measuring the global, angularly-averaged signal. Instruments used for the latter purpose have traditionally lacked angular resolution, and consist of (for instance) a single dipole. The lack of angular resolution can make foreground subtraction difficult, and we show that with better angular resolution, one can obtain global 21cm spectra with much smaller error bars. We also show that by incorporating some knowledge about the rough shape of the expected spectra, one can greatly increase the statistical significance with which cosmological signatures can be detected.},

abstract = {We present radio images of two giant quasars from the Molonglo/1 Jy sample, and make a comparative study of giant radio sources selected from the literature with 3CR radio sources of smaller sizes to investigate the evolution of giant sources, and test their consistency with the unified scheme. The luminosity-size diagram shows that the giant sources are less luminous than smaller-sized sources, consistent with evolutionary scenarios where the giants have evolved from the smaller sources, losing energy as they expand. For the giant sources the equipartition magnetic fields are smaller, and inverse-Compton losses with the microwave background radiation dominates over synchrotron losses, while the reverse is true for the smaller sources. The giant radio sources have core strengths similar to those of smaller sources of similar total luminosity; hence their large sizes are unlikely to be due to stronger nuclear activity. The radio properties of the giant radio galaxies and quasars are consistent with the unified scheme.},

title = {Sources of the Radio Background Considered},
abstract = {We investigate possible origins of the extragalactic radio background reported by the ARCADE 2 collaboration. The surface brightness of the background is several times higher than that which would result from currently observed radio sources. We consider contributions to the background from diffuse synchrotron emission from clusters and the intergalactic medium, previously unrecognized flux from low surface brightness regions of radio sources, and faint point sources below the flux limit of existing surveys. By examining radio source counts available in the literature, we conclude that most of the radio background is produced by radio point sources that dominate at sub microJy fluxes. We show that a truly diffuse background produced by electrons far from galaxes is ruled out because such energetic electrons would overproduce the obserevd X-ray/gamma-ray background through inverse Compton scattering of the other photon fields. Unrecognized flux from low surface brightness regions of extended radio sources, or moderate flux sources missed entirely by radio source count surveys, cannot explain the bulk of the observed background, but may contribute as much as 10%. We consider both radio supernovae and radio quiet quasars as candidate sources for the background, and show that both fail to produce it at the observed level because of insufficient number of objects and total flux, although radio quiet quasars contribute at the level of at least a few percent. We conclude that the most important population for production of the background is likely ordinary starforming galaxies above redshift 1 characterized by an evolving radio far-infrared correlation, which increases toward the radio loud with redshift.},

title = {Detecting reionization in the star formation histories of high-redshift galaxies},
abstract = {The reionization of cosmic hydrogen, left over from the big bang, increased its temperature to >~104K. This photoheating resulted in an increase of the minimum mass of galaxies and hence a suppression of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). The affected population of dwarf galaxies included the progenitors of massive galaxies that formed later. We show that a massive galaxy at a redshift z >~ 6 should show a double-peaked star formation history marked by a clear break. This break reflects the suppression signature from reionization of the region in which the galaxy was assembled. Since massive galaxies originate in overdense regions where cosmic evolution is accelerated, their environment reionizes earlier than the rest of the universe. For a galaxy of ~1012Msolar in stars at a redshift of z ~ 6.5, the SFR should typically be suppressed at a redshift z >~ 10 since the rest of the universe is known to have reionized by z >~ 6.5. Indeed, this is inferred to be the case for HUDF-JD2, a massive galaxy which is potentially at z ~ 6.5 but is inferred to have formed the bulk of its 3 × 1011Msolar in stars at z >~ 9.},

title = {The nature and evolution of the highly ionized near-zones in the  absorption spectra of z~6 quasars},
abstract = { We use state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations combined with a 1D radiative transfer code to assess the extent to which the highly ionized regions observed close to z~6 quasars, which we refer to as near-zones, can constrain the ionization state of the surrounding IGM. We find the appearance in Lya absorption of a quasar HII ionization front expanding into a neutral IGM can be very similar to a classical proximity zone, produced by the enhancement in ionizing flux close to a quasar embedded in a highly ionized IGM. The observed sizes of these highly ionized near-zones and their redshift evolution can be reproduced for a wide range of IGM neutral hydrogen fractions for plausible values of the luminosity and lifetime of the quasars. The observed near-zone sizes at the highest observed redshifts are equally consistent with a significantly neutral and a highly ionized surrounding IGM. Stronger constraints on the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction can be obtained by considering the relative size of the near-zones in the Lya and Lyb regions of a quasar spectrum. A large sample of high quality quasar absorption spectra with accurate determinations of near-zone sizes and their redshift evolution in both the Lya and Lyb regions should confirm or exclude the possibility that the Universe is predominantly neutral at the highest observed redshifts. The width of the discrete absorption features in these near-zones will contain important additional information on the ionization state and the previous thermal history of the IGM at these redshifts. },

title = {Solar and Heliospheric Science with the Murchison Widefield Array},
abstract = {Low radio frequencies (< 300 MHz) offer unique and powerful diagnostics of the Sun and heliosphere. Multiple reasons, however, conspire to make wide-band high-fidelity low radio frequency solar imaging challenging, including the dynamic and spectrally complex nature of solar emission, the large fields of view associated with low radio frequencies, and ionospheric distortion of incident radiation. Till recently this has limited the exploitation of low radio frequencies for solar and heliospheric studies. The recent and continuing advances in capacity and affordability of digital signal processing have enabled a new generation of instruments whose capabilities are well matched to the challenge of low radio frequency imaging. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is amongst the first of these instruments and is currently under construction in the radio quiet Western Australian outback. The MWA will observe in the 80-300 MHz band and will comprise 512 elements, each with 16 dual polarization dipoles arranged in a 4x4 grid, distributed in a centrally condensed manner over a 1.5 km diameter with a small number of outliers extending the baselines to 3 km. Its compact footprint and 130,816 physical baselines provide an unprecedented high-fidelity snap-shot imaging capability for every spectral channel, with 0.5-8 s time resolution and 40 kHz frequency resolution. Solar and heliospheric science is amongst the key science objectives of the MWA. In addition to solar imaging, the MWA will exploit propagation effects like interplanetary scintillation and Faraday rotation to study the solar wind in the inner heliosphere. Here we present a brief overview of the MWA solar and heliospheric science capabilities and some early results from a 32 element engineering prototype currently operating on site. The MWA collaboration includes US, Australian and Indian institutions and the US part of the collaboration is funded by the National Science Foundation.},

It has been difficult to probe to higher redshifts, however, because quasars have historically been identified in optical surveys, which are insensitive to sources at redshifts exceeding 6.5. Here we report observations of a quasar (ULASJ112001.48+064124.3) at a redshift of 7.085, which is 0.77 billion years after the Big Bang. ULASJ1120+0641 has a luminosity of 6.3×1013Lsolar and hosts a black hole with a mass of 2×109Msolar (where Lsolar and Msolar are the luminosity and mass of the Sun). The measured radius of the ionized near zone around ULASJ1120+0641 is 1.9megaparsecs, a factor of three smaller than is typical for quasars at redshifts between 6.0 and 6.4. The near-zone transmission profile is consistent with a Lyα damping wing, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium in front of ULASJ1120+0641 exceeded 0.1.},

title = {An Extension of Hierarchical Star Formation to Galactic Scales},
abstract = {Star formation scaling laws and hierarchical patterns on galactic scales are investigated. The molecular cloud size-line width relation suggests that the duration of star formation in a region of size L should increase as L^1/2^. This conjecture is supported by observations of star- forming regions in our Galaxy and by the distribution of Cepheid variables in the LMC. Extending this relation to galactic scales, we suggest that coherent star formation exists over regions much larger than a single star complex ( > 1 kpc), taking the form of sheared spiral arms whenever the dimension is larger than the galactic thickness. The properties of star-forming spirals in nearby flocculent galaxies are measured; they typically extend for at least one-third of the galaxy diameter and consist of ~5 star complexes separated by ~1 kpc. Star- forming spirals appear to be as self-gravitating as all other scales in the star-formation hierarchy. We propose that stars form in hierarchically clustered systems ranging from less than 0.1 pc to multi- kpc scales, following the hierarchical distribution of the gas. This structure is generated on all scales by self-gravity and turbulence, with distortion from shear being relatively more important on large scales. Turbulent compression and energy loss (rather than collapse) determine the basic evolution time for a region. The hierarchical pattern disappears when the gas temporarily becomes structured by regular forces, as in spiral density waves and swept-up shells. Then clouds and young stars can appear like beads on a string because mild gravitational instabilities at the collapse threshold have a characteristic length of ~3 times the arm or filament width.},

abstract = {The paper presents 1.2 mm contour maps of the SNRs Cassiopeia A and Taurus A (Crab Nebula), obtained with the MPIfR bolometer using the IRTF 3-m and UH 88-in. telescopes on Mauna Kea, with angular resolutions of 90 and 120 arcsec, respectively. These maps are compared with maps at 2.8 cm made with the 100-m telescope and smoothed to the same angular resolution. There is no significant variation in the distribution of surface brightness between 1.2 mm and 2.8 cm for either source, suggesting that in each case the 1.2 mm emission is dominated by synchrotron emission. The synchrotron spectra of both SNRs at millimeter wavelengths are determined by combining the 1.2 mm integrated flux densities with previous measurements at longer wavelengths. Within the error bars the 1.2 mm integrated flux density derived for the Crab Nebula agrees with the synchrotron spectrum of Baars et al. (1977) as extrapolated to 1.2 mm, but that derived for Cas A lies above this extrapolation.},

title = {Multifrequency radio observations of Cygnus A - Spectral aging in powerful radio galaxies},
abstract = {A detailed analysis of the radio spectrum across the lobes of Cygnus A is presented in order to critically test the synchroton spectral aging theory. The results are in good agreement with the jet model for powerful radio galaxies, involving particle acceleration at the hot spots and outflow into the radio lobes, with subsequent energy loss due to synchrotron radiation. The hot spot spectra are well represented by a spectral aging model involving continuous injection of relativistic particles. Both hot spots have spectral break frequencies around 10 GHz. An injection index of 0.5 is found for both hot spots, consistent with diffusive shock acceleration at a strong nonrelativistic shock in a Newtonian fluid. The LF hot spot emission spectrum falls below the injected power law. This effect is isolated to the hot spots, and is best explained by a low-energy cutoff in the particle distribution.},

title = {New Limits on 21 cm Epoch of Reionization from PAPER-32 Consistent with an X-Ray Heated Intergalactic Medium at z = 7.7},
abstract = {We present new constraints on the 21 cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) power spectrum derived from three months of observing with a 32 antenna, dual-polarization deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization in South Africa. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of the delay-spectrum approach to avoiding foregrounds, achieving over eight orders of magnitude of foreground suppression (in mK2). Combining this approach with a procedure for removing off-diagonal covariances arising from instrumental systematics, we achieve a best 2σ upper limit of (41 mK)2 for k = 0.27 h Mpc--1 at z = 7.7. This limit falls within an order of magnitude of the brighter predictions of the expected 21 cm EoR signal level. Using the upper limits set by these measurements, we generate new constraints on the brightness temperature of 21 cm emission in neutral regions for various reionization models. We show that for several ionization scenarios, our measurements are inconsistent with cold reionization. That is, heating of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) is necessary to remain consistent with the constraints we report. Hence, we have suggestive evidence that by z = 7.7, the H I has been warmed from its cold primordial state, probably by X-rays from high-mass X-ray binaries or miniquasars. The strength of this evidence depends on the ionization state of the IGM, which we are not yet able to constrain. This result is consistent with standard predictions for how reionization might have proceeded.},

title = {Interstellar Phases in the Magellanic Clouds},
abstract = {In the seven years since the Australia Telescope Compact Array began spectral line observations, there have been six surveys of lambda21-cm absorption in and around the Magellanic Clouds. These observations tell us about the mixture of warm and cool phases in the atomic gas, about the abundance of diffuse clouds, and about the heating and cooling balance in the interstellar environment of the Magellanic Clouds. The primary result is that the cool atomic phase of the gas is quite abundant. Comparing the integral of the emission spectrum (proportional to the column density of H I) to the integral of the absorption spectrum (equivalent width) gives the mean spin temperature, which measures the relative abundance of warm and cool phases in the atomic medium. The Magellanic Clouds show numbers for the mean spin temperature which are lower than for the Milky Way, suggesting that roughly twice as much of the atomic medium is in the cool, diffuse cloud phase relative to warm, "intercloud" H I. Another interpretation of our results is that the temperature of the gas in typical atomic clouds is lower than in Milky Way diffuse clouds by a factor of two. This is confirmed in a few directions near 30 Dor by profile analysis which allows us to separate the warm and cool phase contributions to the spectra. The typical temperatures for the cool H I in the Clouds may be in the range 25 to 45 K, vs. 50 to 70 K in the solar neighborhood. This fits with the theoretical prediction for heating-cooling balance in a medium with metallicity and dust to gas ratio much less than their "cosmic" values. This result is particularly interesting in the context of the relatively low abundance of CO in the Clouds, especially in the SMC. Either the X factor for conversion of CO intensity to H2 column density is lower than its Milky Way value, and/or the transition between atomic and molecular hydrogen takes place deeper in the cores of dense clouds. This raises the question of whether gravitational collapse and star formation can proceed directly from dense, cold atomic clouds without passing through the molecular cloud stage. Another problem is raised by the discovery of several cool atomic clouds well outside the stellar boundaries of the LMC and SMC, in the H I envelope around the Clouds, and particularly in the Bridge region between them. The pressure in these regions must be surprisingly high for cool phase gas to exist.},

The algorithm is a modification of the algorithm of Cole et al. used in the GALFORM semi-analytic galaxy formation model. As such, it is based on the Extended Press-Schechter theory and so should be applicable to hierarchical models with a wide range of power spectra and cosmological models. It is tuned to be in accurate agreement with the conditional mass functions found in the analysis of merger trees extracted from the Λ cold dark matter Millennium N-body simulation. We present a comparison of its predictions not only with these conditional mass functions, but also with additional statistics of the Millennium Simulation halo merger histories. In all cases, we find it to be in good agreement with the Millennium Simulation and thus it should prove to be a very useful tool for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and for modelling hierarchical structure formation in general.

abstract = {We report the discovery of up to 35 new supernova remnants (SNRs) from a 42" resolution, 90 cm multiconfiguration Very Large Array survey of the Galactic plane covering 4.5d<l<22.0d and |b|<1.25d. Archival 20 cm, 11 cm, and 8 μm data have also been used to identify the SNRs and constrain their properties. The 90 cm image is sensitive to SNRs with diameters 2.5 arcmin to 50' and down to a surface brightness limit of ~10-21 W m-2 Hz-1 sr-1. This survey has nearly tripled the number of SNRs known in this part of the Galaxy and represents an overall 15% increase in the total number of Galactic SNRs. These results suggest that further deep, low-frequency surveys of the inner Galaxy will resolve the discrepancy between the expected number of Galactic SNRs and the significantly smaller number of currently known SNRs.},

title = {ARCADE 2 Observations of Galactic Radio Emission},
abstract = { We use absolutely calibrated data from the ARCADE 2 flight in July 2006 to model Galactic emission at frequencies 3, 8, and 10 GHz. The spatial structure in the data is consistent with a superposition of free-free and synchrotron emission. Emission with spatial morphology traced by the Haslam 408 MHz survey has spectral index beta_synch = -2.5 +/- 0.1, with free-free emission contributing 0.10 +/- 0.01 of the total Galactic plane emission in the lowest ARCADE 2 band at 3.15 GHz. We estimate the total Galactic emission toward the polar caps using either a simple plane-parallel model with csc|b| dependence or a model of high-latitude radio emission traced by the COBE/FIRAS map of CII emission. Both methods are consistent with a single power-law over the frequency range 22 MHz to 10 GHz, with total Galactic emission towards the north polar cap T_Gal = 0.498 +/- 0.028 K and spectral index beta = -2.55 +/- 0.03 at reference frequency 1 GHz. The well calibrated ARCADE 2 maps provide a new test for spinning dust emission, based on the integrated intensity of emission from the Galactic plane instead of cross-correlations with the thermal dust spatial morphology. The Galactic plane intensity measured by ARCADE 2 is fainter than predicted by models without spinning dust, and is consistent with spinning dust contributing 0.4 +/- 0.1 of the Galactic plane emission at 22 GHz. },

title = {Comparison Of Reionization Models: Radiative Transfer Simulations And Approximate, Semi-Numeric Models},
abstract = {We compare the predictions of four different algorithms for the distribution of ionized gas during the Epoch of Reionization. These algorithms are all used to run a 100 Mpc/h simulation of reionization with the same initial conditions. Two of the algorithms are state-of-the-art ray-tracing radiative transfer codes that use disparate methods to calculate the ionization history. The other two algorithms are fast but more approximate schemes based on iterative application of a smoothing filter to the underlying source and density fields. We compare these algorithms' resulting ionization and 21 cm fields using several different statistical measures. The two radiative transfer schemes are in excellent agreement with each other (with the cross-correlation coefficient of the ionization fields >0.8 for k < 10 h/Mpc and in good agreement with the analytic schemes (>0.6 for k < 1 h/Mpc). When used to predict the 21cm power spectrum at different times during reionization, all ionization algorithms agree with one another at the 10s of percent level. This agreement suggests that the different approximations involved in the ray tracing algorithms are sensible and that semi-numerical schemes provide a numerically-inexpensive, yet fairly accurate, description of the reionization process.},

title = {Constraints on Reionization from the Thermal History of the Intergalactic Medium},
abstract = {The temperature of the diffuse, photoheated intergalactic medium (IGM) depends on its reionization history because the thermal timescales are long. The widths of the hydrogen Lyα absorption lines seen in the spectra of distant quasars that arise in the IGM can be used to determine its temperature. We use a wavelet analysis of the Lyα forest region of quasar spectra to demonstrate that there is a relatively sudden increase in the line widths between redshifts z~3.5 and 3.0, which we associate with entropy injection resulting from the reionization of He II. The subsequent falloff in temperature after z~3.5 is consistent with a thermal evolution dominated by adiabatic expansion. If, as expected, the temperature also drops rapidly after hydrogen reionization, then the high temperatures inferred from the line widths before He II reionization imply that hydrogen reionization occurred below redshift z=9.

title = {The precision and accuracy of early Epoch of Reionization foreground  models: comparing MWA and PAPER 32-antenna source catalogs},
abstract = { As observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in redshifted 21cm emission begin, we asses the accuracy of the early catalog results from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and the Murchison Widefield Array. The MWA EoR approach derives much of its sensitivity from subtracting foregrounds to <1% precision while the PAPER approach relies on the stability and symmetry of the primary beam. Both require an accurate flux calibration to set the amplitude of the measured power spectrum. The two instruments are very similar in resolution, sensitivity, sky coverage and spectral range and have produced catalogs from nearly contemporaneous data. We use a Bayesian MCMC fitting method to estimate that the two instruments are on the same flux scale to within 20% and find that the images are mostly in good agreement. We then investigate the source of the errors by comparing two overlapping MWA facets where we find that the differences are primarily related to an inaccurate model of the primary beam but also correlated errors in bright sources due to CLEAN. We conclude with suggestions for mitigating and better characterizing these effects. },

abstract = {We present a measurement of the surface brightness of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) in the Chandra Deep Fields, after excluding all detected X-ray, optical, and infrared sources. The work is motivated by a recent X-ray stacking analysis by Worsley and collaborators, which showed that galaxies detected by HST but not by Chandra may account for most of the unresolved CXB at E>1 keV. We find that after excluding HST and Spitzer IRAC sources, some CXB still remains, but it is marginally significant: (3.4+/-1.4)×10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1 deg-2 in the 1-2 keV band and (4+/-9)×10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1 deg-2 in the 2-5 keV band, or 7%+/-3% and 4%+/-9% of the total CXB, respectively. Of the 1-2 keV signal resolved by the HST sources, 34%+/-2% comes from objects with optical colors typical of ``normal'' galaxies (which make up 25% of the HST sources), while the remaining flux comes from objects with colors of starburst and irregular galaxies. In the 0.65-1 keV band (just above the bright Galactic O VII line), the remaining diffuse intensity is (1.0+/-0.2)×10-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 deg-2. This flux includes emission from the Galaxy as well as from the hypothetical warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), and provides a conservative upper limit on the WHIM signal that comes interestingly close to theoretical predictions.},

title = {Centaurus A - NGC 5128},
abstract = {At a distance of 3.4 Mpc, NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) is by far the nearest active radio galaxy. It is often considered to be the prototype Fanaroff-Riley Class I `low-luminosity' radio galaxy, and as such it plays an important role in our understanding of a major class of active galaxies. Its proximity has spawned numerous detailed investigations of its properties, yielding unrivalled but still incomplete knowledge of its structure and dynamics. The massive elliptical host galaxy is moderately triaxial and contains a thin, strongly warped disk rich in dust, atomic and molecular gas and luminous young stars. Its globular cluster ensemble has a bimodal distribution of metallicities. Deep optical images reveal faint major axis extensions as well as a system of filaments and shells. These and other characteristics are generally regarded as strong evidence that NGC 5128 has experienced a major merging events at least once in its past. The galaxy has a very compact, subparsec nucleus exhibiting noticeable intensity variations at radio and X-ray wavelengths, probably powered by accretion events. The central object may be a black hole of moderate mass. Towards the nucleus, rich absorption spectra of atomic hydrogen and various molecular species suggest the presence of significant amounts of material falling into the nucleus, presumably `feeding the monster'. Emanating from the nucleus are linear radio/X-ray jets, becoming subrelativistic at a few parsec from the nucleus. At about 5 kpc from the nucleus, the jets expand into plumes. Huge radio lobes extend beyond the plumes out to to 250 kpc. A compact circumnuclear disk with a central cavity surrounds the nucleus. Its plane, although at an angle to the minor axis of the galaxy, is perpendicular to the inner jets. The jet-collimating mechanism, probably connected to the circumnuclear disk, appears to precess on timescales of order a few times 107 years. This review summarizes the present state of knowledge of NGC 5128 and its associated radio source Centaurus A. Underlying physical processes are outside its scope: they are briefly referred to, but not discussed.},

title = {Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data},
abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

title = {Toward Epoch of Reionization Measurements with Wide-Field Radio Observations},
abstract = {This paper explores the potential for statistical epoch of reionization (EOR) measurements using wide-field radio observations. New developments in low-frequency radio instrumentation and signal processing allow very sensitive EOR measurements, and the analysis techniques enabled by these advances offer natural ways of separating the EOR signal from the residual foreground emission. This paper introduces the enabling technologies and proposes an analysis technique designed to make optimal use of the capabilities of next-generation low-frequency radio arrays. The observations we propose can directly observe the power spectrum of the EOR using relatively short observations and are significantly more sensitive than other techniques that have been discussed in the literature. For example, in the absence of foreground contamination the measurements we propose would produce five 3 σ power spectrum points in 100 hr of observation with only 4 MHz bandwidth with LOFAR for simple models of the high-redshift 21 cm emission. The challenge of residual foreground removal may be addressed by the symmetries in the three-dimensional (two spatial frequencies and radio frequency) radio interferometric data. These symmetries naturally separate the EOR signal from most classes of residual unsubtracted foreground contamination, including all foreground continuum sources and radio line emission from the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Dynamical searches reveal central dark objects with masses {\$}\sim 10^6{\$}to {\$}10^{9.5}{\$} \msun in the Galaxy, \m31, \mm32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and NGC 4594. Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in {\$}\sim 20\%{\$} of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

title = {A model of diffuse Galactic radio emission from 10 MHz to 100 GHz},
abstract = {Understanding diffuse Galactic radio emission is interesting both in its own right and for minimizing foreground contamination of cosmological measurements. cosmic microwave background experiments have focused on frequencies >~10GHz, whereas 21-cm tomography of the high-redshift universe will mainly focus on <~0.2GHz, for which less is currently known about Galactic emission. Motivated by this, we present a global sky model derived from all publicly available total power large-area radio surveys, digitized with optical character recognition when necessary and compiled into a uniform format, as well as the new Villa Elisa data extending the 1.42-GHz map to the entire sky. We quantify statistical and systematic uncertainties in these surveys by comparing them with various global multifrequency model fits. We find that a principal component based model with only three components can fit the 11 most accurate data sets (at 10, 22, 45 and 408 MHz and 1.42, 2.326, 23, 33, 41, 61, 94 GHz) to an accuracy around 1-10 per cent depending on frequency and sky region. Both our data compilation and our software returning a predicted all-sky map at any frequency from 10 MHz to 100 GHz are publicly available at http://space.mit.edu/home/angelica/gsm.},

abstract = {We consider the degree to which 21 cm tomography of the high-redshift universe can distinguish different ionization histories. Using a new analytic model for the size distribution of H II regions that associates these ionized bubbles with large-scale galaxy overdensities, we compute the angular power spectrum and other statistical properties of the 21 cm brightness temperature during reionization. We show that the H II regions imprint features on the power spectrum that allow us to separate histories with discrete bubbles from those with partial uniform ionization (by, for example, X-rays). We also show that ``double reionization'' scenarios will modify the morphology of the bubbles in ways that depend on the mechanism through which the first generation of sources shuts off. If, for example, the transition occurs globally at a fixed redshift, the first generation imprints a persistent feature on the 21 cm power spectrum. Finally, we compare our model to one in which voids are ionized first. While the power spectra of these two models are qualitatively similar, we show that the underlying distributions of neutral hydrogen differ dramatically and suggest that other statistical tests can distinguish them. The next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes will have the sensitivity to distinguish all of these models and strongly constrain the history and morphology of reionization.},

To meet these science goals, MWA has a very large field of view - up to 50 degrees across at 80 MHz - that makes it well suited for blind searches for astrophysical radio transients. This presentation will provide an overview of the MWA, initial results from a 512-antenna prototype version of the array that began taking observations in 2008, and a description of future plans including transient searches.},

Zenith drift scans with central declination δ = -26.5$\,^{\circ}$ and spanning right ascensions 0 < α < 10 h yielded little variation in the mean spectral index. The mean absolute brightness temperature at ν = 150 MHz was found to reach a minimum of T = 237 $\pm$ 10 K at α = 2.5 h.

abstract = {High resolution, low frequency observations are very efficient for surveying radio galaxies because of: (1) the wide field of view; and (2) the bias toward steep spectrum (lobe dominated) emission. Here I present preliminary results from two ongoing low frequency radio surveys: the 4 Meter All Sky Survey (4MASS) and the low frequency counterpart to the XMM-Large Scale Structure (XMM-LSS) survey. 4MASS is an NRL-NRAO project to survey the entire sky above /δ=-20$\,^{\circ}$ at 74 MHz with a resolution of 1.3/'. So far, 0.66 steradians have been observed and over 5000 objects identified, with the steep spectrum objects being followed up in a search for high redshift radio galaxies. The XMM-Large Scale Structure (XMM-LSS) survey is a major project underway to map the large scale structure of the universe out to cosmological distances. We are conducting a survey at both 325 MHz and 74 MHz in the /8×8 square degree XMM-LSS region. The radio counterpart to this deep X-ray survey is designed to explore the relation of the large scale structure to the location and properties of extragalactic radio sources. Statistical results of preliminary analysis of these two surveys are presented.},

abstract = {After a brief introduction to the morphological properties of FRI radio sources, we discuss the possibility that FRI jets are relativistic at their bases and decelerate quickly to non-relativistic velocities. From two-frequency data we determine spectral index distributions and consequently the ages of FRI sources. We show that in the large majority of cases synchrotron theory provides unambiguous and plausible answers; in a few objects re-acceleration of electrons may be needed. The derived ages are of the order 107-108 years, /~2-4 times larger than the ages inferred from dynamical arguments and a factor /~5-10 larger than the ages of FRII sources. The linear sizes of FRI and FRII sources make it unlikely that many FRII's evolve into FRI's. A brief discussion is given of the possibility that radio sources go through different cycles of activity.},

title = {21 cm Tomography with Foregrounds},
abstract = {Twenty-one centimeter tomography is emerging as a powerful tool to explore the reionization epoch and cosmological parameters, but it will only be as good as our ability to accurately model and remove astrophysical foreground contamination. Previous treatments of this problem have focused on the angular structure of the signal and foregrounds and what can be achieved with limited spectral resolution (channel widths in the 1 MHz range). In this paper we introduce and evaluate a ``blind'' method to extract the multifrequency 21 cm signal by taking advantage of the smooth frequency structure of the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We find that 21 cm tomography is typically limited by foregrounds on scales of k<<1 h Mpc-1 and is limited by noise on scales of k>>1 h Mpc-1, provided that the experimental channel width can be made substantially smaller than 0.1 MHz. Our results show that this approach is quite promising even for scenarios with rather extreme contamination from point sources and diffuse Galactic emission, which bodes well for upcoming experiments such as LOFAR, MWA, PAST, and SKA.},

title = {Imaging the Sun with the Murchison Widefield Array},
abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a low frequency radio synthesis array currently under construction in the radio quiet Western Australian outback. The MWA will be the first of a new generation of interferometers to capitalize on the enormous recent technological advances in the capabilities of digital signal processing hardware and increased affordability of computing. The MWA design has been optimized to provide high fidelity, high cadence imaging capability with high sensitivity to extended emission even with a single spectral channel. This makes the MWA very well suited for studying the sun - a morphologically complex large angular size source from which the emission can show significant time and frequency evolution. The excellent imaging quality of the MWA will stem from its 512 elements distributed in a rather dense and compact manner. Most of the elements will lie within a 1.5 km radius with a few outliers extending out to 3 km. The individual elements will be arrays of 16 dual polarization dipoles arranged in a 4x4 grid and designed to operate in the 80-300 MHz band. The MWA will be able to process 30.72 MHz of bandwidth, which can be distributed in an arbitrary fashion across the observing band in chunks of 1.28 MHz. Radio observations in the MWA band are a sensitive probe of the coronal electron density and temperature distributions (Benkevitch et al. 2009). The solar images from the MWA will allow us to make significant progress in estimating electron temperature distribution in the lower solar corona, where it has remained comparatively inaccessible, and permit an independent estimation of the electron density distribution. We present simulated solar images in the MWA frequency range with precise ray tracing in the corona and account for the instrument transfer function (point spread function) for a few well accepted coronal models with a view to explore this approach. We also include features like streamers and coronal holes, and investigate how well they can be discerned in brightness temperature maps of the sun from the MWA.},

title = {Radio recombination lines at decametre wavelengths. Prospects for the future},
abstract = {This paper considers the suitability of a number of emerging and future instruments for the study of radio recombination lines (RRLs) at frequencies below 200 MHz. These lines are of interest because they arise only in low-density regions of the ionized interstellar medium and because they may represent a frequency-dependent foreground for next-generation experiments trying to detect H I signals from the Universe's Epoch of Reionization and Dark Ages (so-called ``21-cm cosmology'' observations). We summarize existing decametre-wavelength observations of RRLs, which have detected only carbon RRLs. We then show that, with reference to an interferometric array, the primary instrumental factor limiting detection and study of the RRLs is the areal filling factor of the array. We consider the first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA-1), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-lo), and a future Lunar Radio Array (LRA), all of which are likely to operate at decametre wavelengths. Key advantages that many of these arrays offer include digital signal processing, which should produce more stable and better defined spectral bandpasses; larger frequency tuning ranges; and better angular resolution than that of the previous generation of instruments that have been used in the past for RRL observations. Detecting Galactic carbon RRLs, with optical depths at the level of 10-3, appears feasible for all of these arrays, with integration times ranging from a few hours to as much as 100 h; at optimal frequencies this would permit a Galactic survey. The SKA-lo and LRA, and the LWA-1 and LOFAR at the lowest frequencies, should have a high enough filling factor to detect lines with much lower optical depths, of order 10-4 in a few hundred hours. The amount of RRL-hosting gas present in the Galaxy at the high Galactic latitudes likely to be targeted in Epoch of Reionization and Dark Ages H I studies is currently unknown. If present, however, the spectral fluctuations from RRLs could be comparable to or exceed the anticipated HI signals.},

Particular attention is given to two methods, namely, redundant baseline calibration and full self-calibration. The first method determines corrections directly from the data without assumptions about the brightness distribution. The second method is based on a field model which is determined using the data to be calibrated and is refined in subsequent self-calibration iterations. Both methods are capable of considerably improving the dynamic range of the resulting maps: from about 1:100 to 1:10,000 or even 1:100,000.},

title = {The demography of massive central black holes},
abstract = {There are currently around 10 galaxies for which there is strong evidence for a massive central black hole. Kormendy {\&} Richstone have pointed out a striking correlation between galaxy and BH mass, namely M_bh ~ 0.004M_gal. An interesting question is whether this correlation is due to a narrow ridge in the probability distribution p(M_bh|M_gal), or whether it is merely a selection effect. We attempt to answer this question using a sample of 36 galaxies for which HST photometry and ground-based kinematics are available. Each galaxy is assumed to be axisymmetric, with an arbitrary inclination angle, and a central BH of arbitrary mass. Moreover, each is assumed to be well described by a two-integral DF. These assumptions allow us to calculate the likelihood of the sample given any p(M_bh|M_gal), and thus to calculate bookmakers' odds for different assumed forms for the latter.},

title = {The Precision and Accuracy of Early Epoch of Reionization Foreground Models: Comparing MWA and PAPER 32-antenna Source Catalogs},
abstract = {As observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in redshifted 21 cm emission begin, we assess the accuracy of the early catalog results from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA). The MWA EoR approach derives much of its sensitivity from subtracting foregrounds to <1% precision, while the PAPER approach relies on the stability and symmetry of the primary beam. Both require an accurate flux calibration to set the amplitude of the measured power spectrum. The two instruments are very similar in resolution, sensitivity, sky coverage, and spectral range and have produced catalogs from nearly contemporaneous data. We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method to estimate that the two instruments are on the same flux scale to within 20% and find that the images are mostly in good agreement. We then investigate the source of the errors by comparing two overlapping MWA facets where we find that the differences are primarily related to an inaccurate model of the primary beam but also correlated errors in bright sources due to CLEAN. We conclude with suggestions for mitigating and better characterizing these effects.},

title = {The Epoch of Reionization Window: II. Statistical Methods for Foreground Wedge Reduction},
abstract = {For there to be a successful measurement of the 21 cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) power spectrum, it is crucial that foreground contaminants be robustly suppressed. These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as Galactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all share the property of being spectrally smooth. When considered with the chromatic response of an interferometric measurement, spectrally smooth foregrounds contaminate a signature "wedge" region in cylindrical {\$}k_\perp k_\parallel{\$} Fourier space. The complement of the foreground wedge is termed the "EoR window", and is expected to be mostly foreground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper is a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical framework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be enlarged, thereby increasing power spectrum sensitivity. We adapt the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm cosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to basic estimators (where Fourier modes are simply squared and binned without regard for the covariance between modes). The optimal quadratic estimator uses both spatial and spectral information to reduce errors, and (compared to the basic estimators) suppresses foregrounds by a factor of {\$}\sim 10^5{\$} in power at the peripheries of the EoR window. If numerical issues can be finessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged, enabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge. These techniques do not assume that foreground are Gaussian-distributed, and we additionally prove that a final round of foreground subtraction can be performed after decorrelation in a way that is guaranteed to have no cosmological signal loss.},

abstract = {The reionization of the Universe is expected to have left a signal in the form of a sharp step in the spectrum of the sky. If reionization took place at 5 <~ z_ion <~ 20, a feature should be present in the radio sky at 70<~ nu <~ 240 MHz due to redshifted H I 21-cm line emission, accompanied by another feature in the optical/near-IR at 0.7<~ lambda <~ 2.6 mu m due to hydrogen recombination radiation. The expected amplitude is well above fundamental detection limits, and the sharpness of the feature may make it distinguishable from variations due to galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. Because this is essentially a continuum measurement of a signal which occurs over the whole sky, relatively small telescopes may suffice for detection in the radio. In the optical/near-IR, a space telescope is needed with the lowest possible background conditions, since the experiment will be severely background-limited.},

abstract = { We present new constraints on the 21cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) power spectrum derived from 3 months of observing with a 32-antenna, dual-polarization deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of the delay-spectrum approach to avoiding foregrounds, achieving over 8 orders of magnitude of foreground suppression (in mK^2). Combining this approach with a procedure for removing off-diagonal covariances arising from instrumental systematics, we achieve a best 2-sigma upper limit of (52 mK)^2 for k=0.11 h Mpc^-1 at z=7.7. This limit falls within an order of magnitude of the brighter predictions of the expected 21cm EoR signal level. Using the upper limits set by these measurements, we generate new constraints on the brightness temperature of 21cm emission in neutral regions for various reionization models. We show that for several ionization models, heating of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) is necessary to remain consistent with the constraints we report. Hence, we have suggestive evidence that by z=7.7, the HI has been warmed from its cold primordial state, probably by X-rays from high-mass X-ray binaries or mini-quasars. },

title = {Massive Black Holes as Population III Remnants},
abstract = {Recent numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in hierarchical cosmogonies have suggested that the very first stars (the so-called Population III) may have been rather massive. Here we point out that a numerous population of massive black holes (MBHs)-with masses intermediate between those of stellar and supermassive holes-may be the end product of such an episode of pregalactic star formation. If only one MBH with m*>~150 Msolar formed in each of the ``minihalos'' collapsing at z~20 from 3 σ fluctuations, then the mass density of Population III MBHs would be comparable to that of the supermassive variety observed in the nuclei of galaxies. Since they form in high-σ rare density peaks, relic MBHs are predicted to cluster in the bulges of present-day galaxies as they become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger systems. Dynamical friction would cause >~50 (m*/150 Msolar)1/2 such objects to sink toward the center. The presence of a small cluster of MBHs in galaxy nuclei may have several interesting consequences associated with it, such as tidal captures of ordinary stars (likely followed by disruption), MBH capture by the central supermassive black hole, and gravitational wave radiation from such coalescences. Accreting pregalactic MBHs may be detectable as ultraluminous, off-nuclear X-ray sources.},

abstract = {This work describes a new instrument optimized for a detection of the neutral hydrogen 21 cm power spectrum between redshifts of 0.5 and 1.5: the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Broadband and Broad-beam (BAOBAB) array. BAOBAB will build on the efforts of a first generation of 21 cm experiments that are targeting a detection of the signal from the Epoch of Reionization at z ~ 10. At z ~ 1, the emission from neutral hydrogen in self-shielded overdense halos also presents an accessible signal, since the dominant, synchrotron foreground emission is considerably fainter than at redshift 10. The principle science driver for these observations are baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum which have the potential to act as a standard ruler and constrain the nature of dark energy. BAOBAB will fully correlate dual-polarization antenna tiles over the 600-900 MHz band with a frequency resolution of 300 kHz and a system temperature of 50 K. The number of antennas will grow in staged deployments, and reconfigurations of the array will allow for both traditional imaging and high power spectrum sensitivity operations. We present calculations of the power spectrum sensitivity for various array sizes, with a 35 element array measuring the cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction as a function of redshift, and a 132 element system detecting the BAO features in the power spectrum, yielding a 1.8% error on the z ~ 1 distance scale, and, in turn, significant improvements to constraints on the dark energy equation of state over an unprecedented range of redshifts from ~0.5 to 1.5.},

abstract = {We use absolutely calibrated data between 3 and 90 GHz from the 2006 balloon flight of the ARCADE 2 instrument, along with previous measurements at other frequencies, to constrain models of extragalactic emission. Such emission is a combination of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) monopole, Galactic foreground emission, the integrated contribution of radio emission from external galaxies, any spectral distortions present in the CMB, and any other extragalactic source. After removal of estimates of foreground emission from our own Galaxy, and the estimated contribution of external galaxies, we present fits to a combination of the flat-spectrum CMB and potential spectral distortions in the CMB. We find 2 sigma upper limits to CMB spectral distortions of mu < 5.8 x 10^{-5} and Y_ff < 6.2 x 10^{-5}. We also find a significant detection of a residual signal beyond that which can be explained by the CMB plus the integrated radio emission from galaxies estimated from existing surveys. After subtraction of an estimate of the contribution of discrete radio sources, this unexplained signal is consistent with extragalactic emission in the form of a power law with amplitude 1.06 \pm 0.11 K at 1 GHz and a spectral index of -2.56 \pm 0.04.},

title = {Detecting the Rise and Fall of 21 cm Fluctuations with the Murchison Widefield Array},
abstract = {We forecast the sensitivity with which the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can measure the 21 cm power spectrum of cosmic hydrogen. The MWA is sensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of k~0.1-1 h Mpc-1). This amounts primarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift evolution in these quantities can yield important information about reionization. We examine a range of theoretical models, spanning uncertainties in the nature of the ionizing sources and the abundance of minihalos during reionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially among these models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales (k~0.4 h Mpc-1) peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM) is ~50% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum flattens as the ionization fraction increases and the sizes of the H II regions grow. With regards to detection sensitivity, we show that the optimal MWA antenna configuration for power spectrum measurements would pack all 500 antenna tiles as closely as possible in a compact core. Detecting the characteristic redshift evolution of our models will help to confirm that observed 21 cm fluctuations originate from the IGM, and not from foregrounds, and will provide an indirect constraint on the evolution of the volume-filling factor of H II regions during reionization. After two years of observations, the MWA can constrain the filling factor at an epoch when i>~0.5 to within roughly +/-δi>~0.1 at 2 σ confidence.},

abstract = {Spectro-polarimetric data at radio wavelengths provide a probe of cosmic magnetic fields both within our Galaxy and the extragalactic Universe. Wide-field interferometric observations are beginning to make significant advances in our understanding of cosmic magnetism. The DRAO Synthesis Telescope in Penticton Canada has been used to carry out arcminute-resolution deep surveys of the polarized emission from extragalactic sources at 1.4 GHz at high latitude, achieving a sensitivity of 45 μJy. These data show an increase in the average fractional polarization of AGN integrated radio emission down to the sub-mJy regime. This trend can be explained only partially via models that include a luminosity dependence of polarization for FR I radio galaxies. The deep polarization sky thus presents a puzzle that cannot be understood by simple extrapolations of properties of the strong AGN source population. We have also re-analysed the visibility data from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) to create a RM image of the sky from over thirty-seven thousand RM values covering the region north of δ = - 40$\,^{\circ}$. The resolution and sensitivity of these data allow background radio sources to be used as probes of the Faraday rotation from the magneto-ionic medium of the Milky Way and the structure of the Galactic magnetic field. The results of these large-area and deep polarimetric observations point the way for new polarization surveys such as GALFACTS and planned surveys with the GMRT and SKA pathfinders.},

title = {z ~ 7-10 Galaxies in the HUDF and GOODS Fields: UV Luminosity Functions},
abstract = {We use all available deep optical ACS and near-IR data over both the HUDF and the two GOODS fields to search for star-forming galaxies at z>~7 and constrain the UV LF within the first 700 Myr. Our data set includes ~23 arcmin2 of deep NICMOS J+H data and ~248 arcmin2 of ground-based (ISAAC+MOIRCS) data, coincident with ACS optical data of greater or equal depths. In total, we find eight ~7.3 z-dropouts in our search fields, but no z~9 J-dropout candidates. A careful consideration of a wide variety of different contaminants suggest an overall contamination level of just ~12% for our z-dropout selection. After performing detailed simulations to accurately estimate the selection volumes, we derive constraints on the UV LFs at z~7 and z~9. For a faint-end slope α=-1.74, our most likely values for M*UV and φ* at z~7 are -19.8+/-0.4 mag and 1.1+1.7-0.7×10-3 Mpc-3, respectively. Our search results for z~9 J-dropouts set a 1 σ lower limit on M*UV of -19.6 mag assuming that φ* and α are the same as their values at slightly later times. This lower limit on M*UV is 1.4 mag fainter than our best-fit value at z~4, suggesting that the UV LF has undergone substantial evolution over this time period. No evolution is ruled out at 99% confidence from z~7 to z~6 and at 80% confidence from z~9 to z~7. We find that the mass-to-light ratio of halos evolves as ~(1+z)-1 if we require that the observed brightening in M*UV with redshift [i.e., M*UV=(-21.02+/-0.09)+(0.36+/-0.08)(z-3.8)] be consistent with the expected evolution in the halo mass function. Finally, we consider the shape of the UV LF at z>~5 and discuss the implications of the Schechter-like form of the observed LFs, particularly the unexpected abrupt cutoff at the bright end.

A series of Earth-rotation measurements, at different cone angles but with baselines of equal lengthb, can be regarded as being made on a baseline sphere of radiusb, the analog of theuvplane in Fourier-type synthesis. The measured output distribution can be expanded as a spherical harmonic series on the baseline sphere. The coefficients of the series are related to the coefficients of the spherical harmonic series expansion of the source distribution on the celestial sphere by a matrix transformation. The matrix [B] is a function only of the baseline configuration (it does not vary with source declination). Inversion of the matrix leads to the solution for the source coefficients, from which a spherical harmonic map is formed of the source distribution.},

From these activities we report on system performance, including primary beam model verification, dependence of system gain on ambient temperature, measurements of receiver and overall system temperatures, and characterization of the RFI environment at each deployment site. We present an all-sky map synthesized between 139 MHz and 174 MHz using data from both arrays that reaches down to 80 mJy (4.9 K, for a beam size of 2.15e-5 sr at 156 MHz), with a 10 mJy (620 mK) thermal noise level that indicates what would be achievable with better foreground subtraction. We calculate angular power spectra (C ell) in a cold patch and determine them to be dominated by point sources, but with contributions from galactic synchrotron emission at lower radio frequencies and angular wavemodes. Although the sample variance of foregrounds dominates errors in these power spectra, we measure a thermal noise level of 310 mK at ell = 100 for a 1.46 MHz band centered at 164.5 MHz. This sensitivity level is approximately 3 orders of magnitude in temperature above the level of the fluctuations in 21 cm emission associated with re-ionization.},

Our observations span the instantaneous frequency band 170.9- 201.6 MHz. Though our observing period is characterized as a period of "low" to "medium" activity, one broadband emission feature and numerous short-lived, narrowband, non-thermal emission features are evident. Our data represent a significant advance in low radio frequency solar imaging, enabling us to follow the spatial, spectral, and temporal evolution of events simultaneously and in unprecedented detail. The rich variety of features seen here reaffirms the coronal diagnostic capability of low radio frequency emission and provides an early glimpse of the nature of radio observations that will become available as the next generation of low-frequency radio interferometers come online over the next few years.},

title = {The observed ionization rate of the intergalactic medium and the  ionizing emissivity at z >5: Evidence for a photon starved and extended epoch  of reionization},
abstract = { We use a large set of hydrodynamical simulations, combined with measurements of the Lyman alpha opacity of the IGM taken from the literature, to obtain robust estimates for the photoionization rate per hydrogen atom at z=5 and 6. We find the photoionization rate drops by a factor of two and four, respectively, compared to our recent measurements at z = 2 - 4. The number of ionizing photons emitted by known sources at z=5 and 6, based on an extrapolation of source numbers below the detection limit and standard assumptions for the relationship between the ionizing emissivity and observed luminosity density at 1500 Angstroms, are in reasonable agreement with the photoionization rates inferred from the Lyman alpha forest if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is large (>= 20 per cent). Claims to the contrary may be attributed to the adoption of an unduly high value for the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen. Using physically motivated assumptions for the mean free path of ionizing photons our measurements of the photoionization rate can be turned into an estimate of the ionizing emissivity. In comoving units the inferred ionizing emissivity is nearly constant over the redshift range 2-6 and corresponds to 1.5-3 photons emitted per hydrogen atom over a time interval corresponding to the age of the Universe at z=6. This strongly suggests that the epoch of reionization was photon-starved and extended. [Abridged] },

title = {Understanding radio polarimetry. V. Making matrix self-calibration work: processing of a simulated observation},
abstract = {Context: .This is Paper V in a series on polarimetric aperture synthesis based on the algebra of 2×2 matrices. Aims: .It validates the matrix self-calibration theory of the preceding Paper IV and outlines the algorithmic methods that had to be developed for its application. Methods: .New avenues of polarimetric self-calibration opened up in Paper IV are explored by processing a simulated observation. To focus on the polarimetric issues, it is set up so as to sidestep some of the common complications of aperture synthesis, yet properly represent physical conditions. In addition to a representative collection of observing errors, the simulated instrument includes strongly varying Faraday rotation and antennas with unequal feeds. The selfcal procedure is described in detail, including aspects in which it differs from the scalar case, and its effects are demonstrated with a number of intermediate image results. Results: .The simulation's outcome is in full agreement with the theory. The nonlinear matrix equations for instrumental parameters are readily solved by iteration; a convergence problem is easily remedied with a new ancillary algorithm. Instrumental effects are cleanly separated from source properties without reference to changes in parallactic rotation during the observation. Polarimetric images of high purity and dynamic range result. As theory predicts, polarimetric errors that are common to all sources inevitably remain; prior knowledge of the statistics of linear and circular polarization in a typical observed field can be applied to eliminate most of them. Conclusions: .The paper conclusively demonstrates that matrix selfcal per se is a viable method that may foster substantial advancement in the art of radio polarimetry. For its application in real observations, a number of issues must be resolved that matrix selfcal has in common with its scalar sibling, such as the treatment of extended sources and the familiar sampling and aliasing problems. The close analogy between scalar interferometry and its matrix-based generalisation suggests that one may apply well-developed methods of scalar interferometry. Marrying these methods to those of this paper will require a significant investment in new software. Two such developments are known to be foreseen or underway.},

title = {Galactic polarization surveys},
abstract = {Following the detection of polarized diffuse Galactic emission in 1962 a number of surveys were undertaken at low frequencies in the following years resulting in important insights on the local magnetic field, polarization of the giant radio loops and other Galactic structures, as well as on the properties of the diffuse magnetized interstellar medium. This field of research experienced a revival in the eighties and nineties by a number of high resolution observations at low and high frequencies, which showed a large variety of polarization structures having no corresponding signature in the total intensity images. 'Canals' and 'Faraday screens' were reported, which clearly indicate that Faraday rotation in the magneto-ionic medium may largely vary on small scales. These findings called for a systematic approach and a number of new unbiased polarization surveys were started. Also new attempts for absolute calibration are under way, which is a critical issue when interpreting polarization structures. This paper reviews polarization survey projects and also summarizes recent results and interpretations of this rather active field of research.},

abstract = {We have defined a complete sample of 228 southern radio sources at 408 MHz with integrated flux densities S408>4.0 Jy, Galactic latitude |b|>10deg, and declination -85deg<δ<-30deg. The main finding survey used was the Molonglo Reference Catalogue. We describe in detail how the Molonglo Southern 4 Jy sample (MS4) was assembled and its completeness assessed. Sources in the sample were imaged at 843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope to obtain positions accurate to about 1", as well as flux densities and angular sizes; follow-up radio and optical observations are presented in Paper II. Radio spectra for the MS4 have been compiled from the literature and used to estimate flux densities at 178 MHz. The strong-source subset of MS4, with S178>10.9 Jy (SMS4), provides a southern sample closely equivalent to the well-studied northern 3CRR sample. Comparison of SMS4 with 3CRR shows a reassuring similarity in source density and median flux density between the two samples.},

title = {Radio observational constraints on Galactic 3D-emission models},
abstract = {Context: Our position inside the Galaxy requires 3D-modelling to obtain the distribution of the Galactic magnetic field, cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and thermal electrons. Aims: Our intention is to find a Galactic 3D-model which agrees best with available radio observations. Methods: We constrain simulated all-sky maps in total intensity, linear polarization, and rotation measure (RM) by observations. For the simulated maps as a function of frequency we integrate in 15' wide cones the emission along the line of sight calculated from Galactic 3D-models. We test a number of large-scale magnetic field configurations and take the properties of the warm interstellar medium into account. Results: From a comparison of simulated and observed maps we are able to constrain the regular large-scale Galactic magnetic field in the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. The local regular field is 2 μG and the average random field is about 3 μG. The known local excess of synchrotron emission originating either from enhanced CR electrons or random magnetic fields is able to explain the observed high-latitude synchrotron emission. The thermal electron model (NE2001) in conjunction with a proper filling factor accounts for the observed optically thin thermal emission and low frequency absorption by optically thick emission. A coupling factor between thermal electrons and the random magnetic field component is proposed, which in addition to the small filling factor of thermal electrons increases small-scale RM fluctuations and thus accounts for the observed depolarization at 1.4 GHz. Conclusions: We conclude that an axisymmetric magnetic disk field configuration with reversals inside the solar circle fits available observations best. Out of the plane a strong toroidal magnetic field with different signs above and below the plane is needed to account for the observed high-latitude RMs. The large field strength is a consequence of the small thermal electron scale height of 1 kpc, which also limits the CR electron extent up to a height of 1 kpc not to contradict with the observed synchrotron emission out of the plane. Our preferred 3D-model fits the observed Galactic total intensity and polarized emission better than other models over a wide frequency range and also agrees with the observed RM from extragalactic sources.},

title = {The radio galaxy PictorA -- a study with the VLA},
abstract = {Detailed multi-frequency VLA observations of the prominent southern radio galaxy PictorA are described. The radio structure is found to comprise very dim, nearly circular lobes with an extraordinarily bright and compact hot spot located at the western extremity of the western lobe. A faint jet is observed to connect this hot spot with the radio nucleus. No counter-jet is seen. The eastern lobe contains two hot spots of much lesser brightness and compactness. The radio lobes have significantly different spectral indices, with the eastern (un-jetted) lobe being `steeper'. Enhanced spectral steepening is found in the central regions surrounding the radio nucleus, and around the peripheries of both radio lobes. The eastern lobe depolarizes at a higher frequency than the western lobe, and also displays a much higher rms scatter in the derived rotation measure, although the mean rotation measure is very similar in both lobes. Steepening of the high frequency spectral index (lambda 6cm to lambda 2cm) is seen in the lobe near to the western hot spot. >From the similarity in the structure of the western hot spot -- including the extended filament -- between radio and optical wavelength ranges it is concluded that all of the extended optical emission is due to the synchrotron process. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Understanding cosmic reionization requires the identification and characterization of early sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. The 2012 Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF12) campaign has acquired the deepest infrared images with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard Hubble Space Telescope and, for the first time, systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmic microwave background (CMB) data indicate reionization was underway. The UDF12 campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance, luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forming galaxies. We synthesize the new UDF12 results with the most recent constraints from CMB observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (UV) luminosity densities, reionization histories, and electron scattering optical depth evolution consistent with the available data. Under reasonable assumptions about the escape fraction of hydrogen-ionizing photons and the intergalactic medium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshift z ~ 6 the population of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z ~ 7-9 likely must extend in luminosity below the UDF12 limits to absolute UV magnitudes of M UV ~ --13 or fainter. Moreover, low levels of star formation extending to redshifts z ~ 15-25, as suggested by the normal UV colors of z   7-8 galaxies and the smooth decline in abundance with redshift observed by UDF12 to z  10, are additionally likely required to reproduce the optical depth to electron scattering inferred from CMB observations.},

The observations at frequencies higher than 635 MHz were made using the 64 m diameter radio telescope at the Australian National Radio Astronomy Observatory. At 468 and 1403 MHz the 18 m and 64 m telescopes were used together as an interferometer. Most of the measurements have an accuracy equal to or greater than previously published data, typically smaller than 2.4% at 635 MHz and 1.8% at 2700 MHz. The flux densities are on the absolute scale proposed by Mills (1973) and are thought to be accurate within about 5% above 400 MHz. On the basis of these data and other reported flux densities between 10 and 10,000 MHz, spectra are derived. A network of accurate flux density calibration sources for declinations south of +20 deg is suggested.},

title = {Distinguishing models of reionization using future radio observations of 21-cm 1-point statistics},
abstract = {We explore the impact of reionization topology on 21-cm statistics. Four reionization models are presented which emulate large ionized bubbles around over-dense regions (21CMFAST/ global-inside- out), small ionized bubbles in over-dense regions (local-inside-out), large ionized bubbles around under-dense regions (global-outside-in) and small ionized bubbles around under-dense regions (local-outside-in). We show that first-generation instruments might struggle to distinguish global models using the shape of the power spectrum alone. All instruments considered are capable of breaking this degeneracy with the variance, which is higher in outside-in models. Global models can also be distinguished at small scales from a boost in the power spectrum from a positive correlation between the density and neutral-fraction fields in outside-in models. Negative skewness is found to be unique to inside-out models and we find that pre-SKA instruments could detect this feature in maps smoothed to reduce noise errors. The early, mid and late phases of reionization imprint signatures in the brightness-temperature moments, we examine their model dependence and find pre-SKA instruments capable of exploiting these timing constraints in smoothed maps. The dimensional skewness is introduced and is shown to have stronger signatures of the early and mid-phase timing if the inside-out scenario is correct.},

title = {Detection and Fundamental Applications of Individual First Galaxies},
abstract = {First galaxies that formed within halos of mass M=107.5-109 Msolar at z=30-40 in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) universe may each display an extended hydrogen 21 cm absorption halo against the cosmic microwave background, with a brightness temperature decrement of δT=-(100-150) mK at a radius 0.3<=r<=3.0 Mpc comoving, corresponding to an angular size of 10"-100". A 21 cm tomographic survey in the redshift shell z=30-40 (at 35-45 MHz) is expected to encompass millions of first galaxies and may prove exceedingly profitable in enabling (at least) four fundamental applications for cosmology and galaxy formation. First, it may yield direct information on star formation physics in first galaxies. Second, it could provide a unique and sensitive probe of small-scale power in the standard cosmological model, and hence physics of dark matter and inflation. Third, it would allow for an independent, perhaps ``cleaner'' characterization of interesting features on large scales in the power spectrum, such as the baryonic oscillations. Finally, and possibly the most secure, each 21 cm absorption halo is expected to be highly spherical and faithfully follow the Hubble flow. By applying the Alcock-Paczy{\'n}ski test to a significant sample of first galaxies, one may be able to determine the dark energy equation of state with an accuracy likely only limited by the accuracy with which the matter density can be determined independently.},

abstract = {We have combined new HI observations of the SMC from the Parkes telescope with the aperture synthesis mosaic from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to obtain a set of images sensitive to all angular (spatial) scales between 98" (30 pc) and 4 deg (4 kpc). The new data are used to study the HI spatial power spectrum over a very wide range of scale sizes. The spatial power spectrum closely obeys the relation, P(k) propto kgamma, with gamma = -3.04 +/- 0.02, similar to values obtained by other authors for our own Galaxy which are in the range gamma = -3.0 to -2.8. This is surprising given the very different morphology, gas-richness, star-formation rate and evolution of the two systems, and may imply similar mechanisms for structure formation. One interpretation of the P(k) power-law is that the interstellar medium (ISM) of the SMC is fractal in nature, consisting of a hierarchy of HI cloud structures created, for example, by homogeneous turbulence. The projected fractal dimension of Dp=1.5 is similar to values obtained by other authors for molecular clouds in the Galaxy in the size range 0.05 to 100 pc. Such a model is consistent with a low space-filling factor for the neutral gas.},

title = {The morphology of HII regions during reionization},
abstract = {It is possible that the properties of HII regions during reionization depend sensitively on many poorly constrained quantities [the nature of the ionizing sources, the clumpiness of the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM), the degree to which photoionizing feedback suppresses the abundance of low-mass galaxies, etc.], making it extremely difficult to interpret upcoming observations of this epoch. We demonstrate that the actual situation is more encouraging, using a suite of radiative transfer simulations, post-processed on outputs from a 10243, 94-Mpc N-body simulation. Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale structures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body simulation. We show that the morphology of the HII regions for reionization by POPII-like stars is most dependent on the global ionization fraction . Changing other parameters by an order of magnitude for fixed often results in similar bubble sizes and shapes. The next most important dependence is on the properties of the ionizing sources. The rarer the sources, the larger and more spherical the HII regions become. The typical bubble size can vary by as much as a factor of 4 at fixed between different possible source prescriptions. The final relevant factor is the abundance of minihaloes or of Lyman-limit systems. These systems suppress the largest bubbles from growing, and the magnitude of this suppression depends on the thermal history of the gas as well as the rate at which these systems are photo-evaporated. We find that neither source suppression owing to photo-heating nor small-scale gas clumping significantly affects the large-scale structure of the HII regions, with the ionization fraction power spectrum at fixed differing by less than 20 per cent for k < 5Mpc-1 between all the source suppression and clumping models we consider. Analytic models of reionization are successful at predicting many of the features seen in our simulations. We discuss how observations of the 21-cm line with the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) can constrain properties of reionization, and we study the effect patchy reionization has on the statistics of Lyα emitting galaxies.},

Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. For transit telescopes such as PAPER, calibration of the primary beam is a difficult endeavor, and errors in this calibration are a major source of error in the determination of source spectra. In order to decrease reliance on accurate beam calibration, we focus on calibrating sources in a narrow declination range from -46d to -40d. Since sources at similar declinations follow nearly identical paths through the primary beam, this restriction greatly reduces errors associated with beam calibration, yielding a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of derived source spectra. Extrapolating from higher frequency catalogs, we derive the flux scale using a Monte-Carlo fit across multiple sources that includes uncertainty from both catalog and measurement errors. Fitting spectral models to catalog data and these new PAPER measurements, we derive new flux models for Pictor A and 31 other sources at nearby declinations. 90% of these confirm and refine a power-law model for flux density. Of note is the new Pictor A flux model, which is accurate to 1.4% and shows, in contrast to previous models, that between 100 MHz and 2 GHz, the spectrum of Pictor A is consistent with a single power law given by a flux at 150 MHz of 382+/-5.4 Jy, and a spectral index of -0.76+/-0.01. This accuracy represents an order of magnitude improvement over previous measurements in this band, and is limited by the uncertainty in the catalog measurements used to estimate the absolute flux scale. The simplicity and improved accuracy of Pictor A's spectrum make it an excellent calibrator for experiments seeking to measure 21cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization.},

abstract = {We present an efficient method to generate large simulations of the epoch of reionization without the need for a full three-dimensional radiative transfer code. Large dark-matter-only simulations are post-processed to produce maps of the redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen. Dark matter haloes are embedded with sources of radiation whose properties are either based on semi-analytical prescriptions or derived from hydrodynamical simulations. These sources could either be stars or power-law sources with varying spectral indices. Assuming spherical symmetry, ionized bubbles are created around these sources, whose radial ionized fraction and temperature profiles are derived from a catalogue of one-dimensional radiative transfer experiments. In case of overlap of these spheres, photons are conserved by redistributing them around the connected ionized regions corresponding to the spheres. The efficiency with which these maps are created allows us to span the large parameter space typically encountered in reionization simulations. We compare our results with other, more accurate, three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations and find excellent agreement for the redshifts and the spatial scales of interest to upcoming 21-cm experiments. We generate a contiguous observational cube spanning redshift 6 to 12 and use these simulations to study the differences in the reionization histories between stars and quasars. Finally, the signal is convolved with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) beam response and its effects are analysed and quantified. Statistics performed on this mock data set shed light on possible observational strategies for LOFAR.},

title = {Probing the First Sources with the Redshifted 21 cm Line},
abstract = {Observations of the redshifted 21 cm line offer a promising probe of early radiation backgrounds. Anisotropies in the 21 cm signal arise from fluctuations in the IGM temperature, density, and neutral fraction and through the Lyman alpha flux. These fluctuations contain a wealth of information on the background radiation field at UV and X-ray frequencies. Before reionization, spatial variation in the Lyman alpha flux from the first sources imprints information about the source distribution on the 21 cm signal. Later, as the IGM is heated by X-rays, inhomogeneous heating leads to gas temperature fluctuations whose detection could constrain the luminosity and spectrum of the first X-ray sources. In this talk, I will discuss theoretical models for both of these mechanisms and outline the possiblities for detection with future experiments. I will also comment on the effect of these sources on galaxy formation. This work was supported at Caltech in part by DoE DE-FG0392-ER40701.},

title = {Understanding radio polarimetry. IV. The full-coherency analogue of scalar self-calibration: Self-alignment, dynamic range and polarimetric fidelity},
abstract = {Paper II of this series studied the calibration process in mostly qualitative terms. In developing the underlying mathematics this paper completes that analysis and extends it in several directions. It exploits the analogy between scalar and matrix algebras to reformulate the self-calibration method in terms of 2 x 2 Jones and coherency matrices. The basic condition that the solutions must satisfy in either case is developed and its consequences are investigated. The fourfold nature of the matrices and the non-commutativity of their multiplication are shown to lead to a number of new effects. In the same way that scalar selfcal leaves the brightness scale undefined, matrix selfcal gives rise to a more complicated indeterminacy. The calibration is far from complete: self-alignment describes more properly what is actually achieved. The true brightness is misrepresented in the image obtained by an unknown brightness-scale factor (as in scalar selfcal) and an undefined poldistortion of the Stokes brightness. The latter is the product of a polrotation of the polvector (Q,U,V) and a polconversion between unpolarized and polarized brightness. The relation of these concepts to conventional ``quasi-scalar'' calibration methods is demonstrated. Like scalar selfcal, matrix self-alignment is shown to suppress spatial scattering of brightness in the image, which is a condition for attaining high dynamic range. Poldistortion of the brightness is an in-place transformation, but must be controlled in order to obtain olarimetric fidelity. The theory is applied to reinterpret the quasi-scalar methods of polarimetry including those of Paper II, and to prove two major new assertions: (a.) An instrument calibrated on an unpolarized calibrator measures the degree of polarization correctly regardless of poldistortion; (b.) Under the usual a priori assumptions, a heterogeneous instrument (i.e. one with unequal feeds) can be completely calibrated without requiring a phase-difference measurement.},

abstract = {In radio astronomy, the correlator measures intensity in visibility space. In addition, the EoR power spectrum measured by an experiment such as the MWA is constructed in visibility space. Thus, correcting for the ionosphere in the uv-plane instead of real space could potentially save computation. In this paper, we study this technique. The mathematical formula for obtaining the unperturbed data from the ionospherically reflected data is non-local in the uv-plane. Moreover, an analytic solution for the unperturbed intensity may only be obtained for a limited number of expansions of the ionospheric perturbations. We numerically study one of these expansions (with perturbations as sinusoidal modes). Obtaining an analytic solution for this expansion required a Taylor expansion, and we investigate the optimal order of this expansion. We also propose a number of potential computation saving techniques, and evaluate their pros and cons.},

In particular, the numerical simulations of this epoch have made a qualitative leap forward, reaching sufficiently large scales to derive the characteristic scales of the reionization process and thus allowing for realistic observational predictions. Our group has recently performed the first such large-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization, run on top of state-of-the-art simulations of early structure formation. This allowed us to make the first realistic observational predictions about the Epoch of Reionization based on detailed radiative transfer and structure formation simulations. We discuss the basic features of reionization derived from our simulations and some recent results on the observational implications for the high-redshift Ly-α sources.},

title = {LOFAR - Opening up a new window on the Universe},
abstract = {LOFAR, the Low Frequency Array, is a next-generation radio telescope that is being built in Northern Europe and expected to be fully operational at the end of this decade. It will operate at frequencies from 15 to 240 MHz (corresponding to wavelengths of 20 to 1.2 m). Its superb sensitivity, high angular resolution, large field of view and flexible spectroscopic capabilities will represent a dramatic improvement over previous facilities at these wavelengths. As such, LOFAR will carry out a broad range of fundamental astrophysical studies. The design of LOFAR has been driven by four fundamental astrophysical applications: (i) The Epoch of Reionisation, (ii) Extragalactic Surveys and their exploitation to study the formation and evolution of clusters, galaxies and black holes, (iii) Transient Sources and their association with high energy objects such as gamma ray bursts, and (iv) Cosmic Ray showers and their exploitation to study the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this conference the foreseen LOFAR work on the epoch of reionisation has been covered by de Bruyn and on cosmic ray showers by Falcke. During this contribution we will first present the LOFAR project with an emphasis on the challenges faced when carrying out sensitive imaging at low radio frequencies. Subsequently, we will discuss LOFAR's capabilities to survey the low-frequency radio sky. Main aims for the planned surveys are studies of z>6 radio galaxies, diffuse emission associated with distant clusters and starbursting galaxies at z>2.},

title = {An absolutely calibrated survey of polarized emission from the northern sky at 1.4 GHz. Observations and data reduction},
abstract = {A new polarization survey of the northern sky at 1.41 GHz is presented. The observations were carried out using the 25.6 m telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Canada, with an angular resolution of 36 arcmin. The data are corrected for ground radiation to obtain Stokes U and Q maps on a well-established intensity scale tied to absolute determinations of zero levels, containing emission structures of large angular extent, with an rms noise of 12 mK. Survey observations were carried out by drift scanning the sky between -29$\,^{\circ}$ and +90$\,^{\circ}$ declination. The fully sampled drift scans, observed in steps of 0.25$\,^{\circ}$ to ˜ 2.5$\,^{\circ}$ in declination, result in a northern sky coverage of 41.7% of full Nyquist sampling. The survey surpasses by a factor of 200 the coverage, and by a factor of 5 the sensitivity, of the Leiden/Dwingeloo polarization survey that was until now the most complete large-scale survey. The temperature scale is tied to the Effelsberg scale. Absolute zero-temperature levels are taken from the Leiden/Dwingeloo survey after rescaling those data by the factor of 0.94. The paper describes the observations, data processing, and calibration steps.

abstract = {Aperture synthesis observations of neutral hydrogen towards the remnant of Tycho's supernova (AD 1572), 3C 10, have been made with the Cambridge Half-Mile Telescope. Details of the absorption features indicate that the distance of 3C 10 is in the range of 1.7-3.7 kpc. The neutral hydrogen in a cloud in the local arm has a spin temperature of about 80 K and an optical depth of order unity. Numerous arc and filamentary structures are seen in emission; some have been analyzed in terms of expanding shells. These are found to have H I masses between 500 solar masses and 280,000 solar masses, and H I kinetic energies between 3.5 x 10 to the 40th J and 6 x 10 to the 43rd J. Stellar winds are proposed as energy sources for two of the arcs because three open clusters are near the center of curvature of one, and a bright star near the center of the other. An open cluster, three 9th mag stars and two CO clouds are seen to coincide with various minima in the H I emission. Two other CO clouds coincide with bright H I emission features, as does the small H II region S175.},

These estimators are the maximum likelihood, the median, Serkowski's mean estimator used by optical astronomers and Wardle and Kronberg's "most probable" which is often applied in radio astronomy. The authors also briefly discuss particular areas where applications of these results are important, namely in polarimetric standards, stellar populations, binary stars, interstellar polarization and extinction measurements at high galactic latitudes.},

title = {Did galaxy assembly and supermassive black-hole growth go hand-in-hand?},
abstract = {In this paper, we address whether the growth of supermassive black-holes has kept pace with the process of galaxy assembly. For this purpose, we first searched the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) for ``tadpole galaxies'', which have a knot at one end plus an extended tail. They appear dynamically unrelaxed---presumably early-stage mergers---and make up ˜6% of the field galaxy population. Their redshift distribution follows that of field galaxies, indicating that---if tadpole galaxies are indeed dynamically young---the process of galaxy assembly generally kept up with the reservoir of field galaxies as a function of epoch. Next, we present a search for HUDF objects with point-source components that are optically variable (at the ≳3.0σ level) on timescales of weeks months. Among 4644 objects to iAB′≃28.0mag (10σ), 45 have variable point-like components, which are likely weak AGN. About ˜1% of all field objects show variability for 0.1 ≲ z ≲ 4.5, and their redshift distribution is similar to that of field galaxies. Hence, supermassive black-hole growth in weak AGN likely also kept up with the process of galaxy assembly. However, the faint AGN sample has almost no overlap with the tadpole sample, which was predicted by recent hydrodynamical numerical simulations. This suggests that tadpole galaxies are early-stage mergers, which likely preceded the ``turn-on'' of the AGN component and the onset of visible point-source variability by ≳1 Gyr.},

title = {Fractal Structure in Galactic Star Fields},
abstract = {The fractal structure of star formation on large scales in disk galaxies is studied using the size distribution function of stellar aggregates in kiloparsec-scale star fields. Archival Hubble Space Telescope images of 10 galaxies are Gaussian-smoothed to define the aggregates, and a count of these aggregates versus smoothing scale gives the fractal dimension. Fractal and Poisson models confirm the procedure. The fractal dimension of star formation in all of the galaxies is ~2.3. This is the same as the fractal dimension of interstellar gas in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, suggesting that star formation is a passive tracer of gas structure defined by self-gravity and turbulence. Dense clusters such as the Pleiades form at the bottom of the hierarchy of structures, where the protostellar gas is densest. If most stars form in such clusters, then the fractal arises from the spatial distribution of their positions, giving dispersed star fields from continuous cluster disruption. Dense clusters should have an upper mass limit that increases with pressure, from ~103 Msolar in regions like the solar neighborhood to ~106 Msolar in starbursts.},

title = {Radio Frequency Spectra of 388 Bright 74 MHz Sources},
abstract = {As a service to the community, we have compiled radio frequency spectra from the literature for all sources within the VLA Low Frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) that are brighter than 15 Jy at 74 MHz. Over 160 references were used to maximize the amount of spectral data used in the compilation of the spectra, while also taking care to determine the corrections needed to put the flux densities from all reference on the same absolute flux density scale. With the new VLSS data, we are able to vastly improve on previous efforts to compile spectra of bright radio sources to frequencies below 100 MHz because (1) the VLSS flux densities are more reliable than those from some previous low-frequency surveys and (2) the VLSS covers a much larger area of the sky (δ>-30deg) than many other low-frequency surveys (e.g., the 8C survey). In this paper, we discuss how the spectra were constructed and how parameters quantifying the shapes of the spectra were derived. Both the spectra and the shape parameters are made available here to assist in the calibration of observations made with current and future low-frequency radio facilities.},

abstract = {We study the prospects for extracting detailed statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen distribution during the era of reionization using the brightness temperature fluctuations from redshifted 21 cm line emission. Detection of this signal is complicated by contamination from foreground sources such as diffuse Galactic synchrotron and free-free emission at low radio frequencies, extragalactic free-free emission from ionized regions, and radio point sources. We model these foregrounds to determine the extent to which 21 cm fluctuations can be detected with upcoming experiments. We find that not only the level of correlation from one frequency to another but also the functional form of the foreground correlations has a substantial impact on foreground removal. We calculate how well the angular power spectra of the 21 cm fluctuations can be determined. We also show that the large-scale bias of the neutral hydrogen gas distribution with respect to the density field can be determined with high precision and used to distinguish between different reionization histories.},

title = {Probing non-Gaussian features in the HI distribution at the epoch of re-ionization},
abstract = {The HI distribution at the epoch of re-ionization (EOR) is largely determined by the sizes and distribution of the ionized regions. In the scenario where the ionized regions have comoving sizes of the order of a few Mpc, the large-scale statistical properties of the HI distribution are dominated by the Poisson noise of the discrete ionized regions and it is highly non-Gaussian. We investigate the possibility of probing re-ionization by studying these non-Gaussian features using future radio-interferometric observations of redshifted 21-cm HI radiation. We develop a formalism relating correlations between the visibilities measured at three different baselines and frequencies to the bispectrum of HI fluctuations. For visibilities at the same frequency, this signal is found to be of the same order as the two visibility correlation, which probes the HI power spectrum. For visibilities at different frequencies, we find that the correlations decay within a frequency difference of ~1 MHz. This implies that it is, in principle, straightforward to extract this HI signal from various contaminants, which are believed to have a continuum spectrum and are expected to be correlated even at large frequency separations.},

title = {Faraday rotation measure synthesis},
abstract = {We extend the rotation measure work of Burn (1966, MNRAS, 133, 67) to the cases of limited sampling of λ2 space and non-constant emission spectra. We introduce the rotation measure transfer function (RMTF), which is an excellent predictor of nπ ambiguity problems with the λ2 coverage. Rotation measure synthesis can be implemented very efficiently on modern computers. Because the analysis is easily applied to wide fields, one can conduct very fast RM surveys of weak spatially extended sources. Difficult situations, for example multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected and transparently handled. Under certain conditions, it is even possible to recover the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized gas. Rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discovering widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (de Bruyn {\&} Brentjens 2005, A{\&}A, 441, 931). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as good as traditional linear fits to χ versus λ2 plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized emission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.},

title = {Supermassive black hole growth and merger rates from cosmological N-body simulations},
abstract = {Understanding how seed black holes (BHs) grow into intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes (IMBHs and SMBHs, respectively) has important implications for the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), galaxy evolution and gravitational wave astronomy. Most studies of the cosmological growth and merger history of BHs have used semianalytic models and have concentrated on SMBH growth in luminous galaxies. We have developed a `hybrid method' that combines high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for the haloes' merger history, with semi-analytical recipes for BH pair dynamics and BH gas accretion. We track the assembly of BHs over a large range of final masses - from seed BHs to SMBHs - over widely varying dynamical histories. We used the dynamics of dark matter haloes to track the evolution of seed BHs in three different gas accretion scenarios. We have found that growth of a Sagittarius A* - size of SMBH reaches its maximum mass MSMBH = ~106Msolar at z ~ 6 through early gaseous accretion episodes, after which it stays at near constant mass. At the same redshift, the duty cycle of the host AGN ends, hence redshift z = 6 marks the transition from an AGN to a starburst galaxy which eventually becomes the Milky Way. By tracking BH growth as a function of time and mass, we estimate that the IMBH merger rate reaches a maximum of Rmax = 55 yr-1 at z = 11. From IMBH merger rates we calculate NULX = 7 per Milky Way type galaxy per redshift in redshift range 2 <~ z <~ 6.},

abstract = {Several recent global and Space VLBI surveys of quasars, Active Galactic Nuclei of other types and star-burst galaxies provide a wealth of material on milli- and sub-milliarcsecond radio structures in hundreds of sources. Results of these projects are presented with an emphasis on the statistics of redshift- and angular-scale-dependent properties of the milli- and sub-milliarcsecond radio structures. These studies make possible disentanglement of intrinsic (possibly, evolutionary) phenomena of parsec-scale radio structures and the imprints of the cosmological model. The studies indicate a very promising potential of high-resolution applications of the Square Kilometer Array. Based on our pilot projects we estimate that a sample containing of the order of 104 faint radio sources in the luminosity range 1022-1026 W/Hz can be surveyed by a high-resolution SKA with the milliarcsecond resolution at cm wavelengths. Such the high resolution radio survey, including those conducted jointly by SKA and Space VLBI missions, in conjunction with data from other domains, will provide a new ground for extragalactic studies.},

title = {Software holography: interferometric data analysis for the challenges of next generation observatories},
abstract = {Next generation radio observatories such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), the Combined Array for Research Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) provide a number of challenges for interferometric data analysis. These challenges include heterogeneous arrays, direction-dependent instrumental gain, and refractive and scintillating atmospheric conditions. From the analysis perspective, this means that calibration solutions cannot be described using a single complex gain per antenna. In this paper, we use the optimal map-making formalism developed for cosmic microwave background analyses to extend traditional interferometric radio analysis techniques - removing the assumption of a single complex gain per antenna and allowing more complete descriptions of the instrumental and atmospheric conditions. Due to the similarity with holographic mapping of radio antenna surfaces, we call this extended analysis approach software holography. The resulting analysis algorithms are computationally efficient, unbiased and optimally sensitive. We show how software holography can be used to solve some of the challenges of next generation observations, and how more familiar analysis techniques can be derived as limiting cases.},

title = {Clustering at 74 MHz},
abstract = {In order to construct accurate point sources simulations at the frequencies relevant to 21 cm experiments, the angular correlation of radio sources must be taken into account. Using the 74 MHz VLSS survey, we measured the angular 2-point correlation function, w(\theta). We obtain the first measurement of clustering at the low frequencies relevant to 21 cm tomography. We find that a single power law with shape w(\theta) = A \theta^{-\gamma} fits well the data. For a galactic cut of 10 degrees, with a data cut of \delta less than -10 degrees, and a flux limit of S = 770 mJy, we obtain a slope of \gamma = (-1.2 +/- 0.35). This value of \gamma is consistent with that measured from other radio catalogues at the millimeter wavelengths. The amplitude of clustering has a length of 0.2 degrees - 0.6 degrees, and it is independent of the flux-density threshold.},

This work complements our studies to trace the cosmological evolution of the host galaxies of high luminosity quasars. The radio-loud (RLQ) and radio-quiet (RQQ) quasars have similar distribution of redshift and luminosity, and together the high and low luminosity quasars cover a large range of the quasar luminosity function. Both RLQ and RQQ hosts resemble massive inactive ellipticals undergoing passive evolution. However, RLQ hosts are systematically more luminous than RQQ hosts, as also found for the high luminosity quasars. The difference in the host luminosity remains the same from z†=†2 to 0. For the entire set of quasars, we find a correlation between the nuclear and the host luminosities, albeit with a large scatter. The correlation is less apparent for the RQQs than for the RLQs.},

abstract = {We compute the expected low-frequency gravitational wave signal from coalescing massive black-hole (MBH) binaries at the centres of galaxies. We follow the merging history of halos and associated holes via cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in a ΛCDM cosmology. MBHs get incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, sink to the centre owing to dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become more massive, and form a binary system. Stellar dynamical processes dominate the orbital evolution of the binary at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii, causing the final coalescence of the system. We discuss the observability of inspiralling MBH binaries by a low-frequency gravitational wave experiment such as the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), discriminating between resolvable sources and unresolved confusion noise. Over a three-year observing period LISA should resolve this GWB into discrete sources, detecting ap90 individual events above a S/N = 5 confidence level, while expected confusion noise is well below planned LISA capabilities.},

title = {Supermassive Black Hole Growth and Merger Rates from Cosmological N-body Simulations},
abstract = {Understanding how seed black holes grow into intermediate and supermassive black holes (IMBHs and SMBHs, respectively) has important implications for the duty-cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), galaxy evolution, and gravitational wave astronomy. Most studies of the cosmological growth and merger history of black holes have used semianalytic models and have concentrated on SMBH growth in luminous galaxies. Using high resolution cosmological N-body simulations, we track the assembly of black holes over a large range of final masses -- from seed black holes to SMBHs -- over widely varying dynamical histories. We used the dynamics of dark matter halos to track the evolution of seed black holes in three different gas accretion scenarios. We have found that growth of a Milky Way size SMBH reaches its maximum mass at redshift 6 through early gaseous accretion episodes, after which it stays at near constant mass. At the same redshift, the duty-cycle of the host AGN ends, hence redshift 6 marks the transition from an AGN to a starburst galaxy which eventually becomes the Milky Way. By tracking black hole growth as a function of time and mass, we estimate that the IMBH merger rate reaches a maximum of 55 per year at redshift 11. From IMBH merger rates we calculate 7 ULXs per Milky Way type galaxy between redshifts 2 and 6.},

abstract = {I update the SKA key science program (KSP) on first light and cosmic reionization. The KSP has two themes: (i) Using the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen as the most direct probe into the evolution of the neutral intergalactic medium during cosmic reionization. Such HI 21cm studies are potentially the most important new window on cosmology since the discovery of the CMB. (ii) Observing the gas, dust, star formation, and dynamics, of the first galaxies and AGN. Observations at cm and mm wavelengths, provide an unobscured view of galaxy formation within 1 Gyr of the Big Bang, and are an ideal complement to the study of stars, ionized gas, and AGN done using near-IR telescopes. I summarize HI 21cm signals, challenges, and telescopes under construction. I also discuss the prospects for studying the pre-galactic medium, prior to first light, using a low frequency telescope on the Moon. I then review the current status of mm and cm observations of the most known distant galaxies (z > 6). I make the simple argument that even a 10% SKA-high demonstrator will have a profound impact on the study of the first galaxies. In particular, extending the SKA to the 'natural' atmospheric limit (set by the O_2 line) of 45 GHz, increases the effective sensitivity to thermal emission by another factor four.},

abstract = {21 cm tomography is emerging as a promising probe of the cosmological dark ages and the epoch of reionization, as well as a tool for observational cosmology in general. However, serious sources of foreground contamination must be subtracted for experimental efforts to be viable. In this paper, we focus on the removal of unresolved extragalactic point sources with smooth spectra, and evaluate how the residual foreground contamination after cleaning depends on instrumental and algorithmic parameters. A crucial but often ignored complication is that the synthesized beam of an interferometer array shrinks towards higher frequency, causing complicated frequency structure in each sky pixel as "frizz" far from the beam center contracts across unresolved radio sources. We find that current-generation experiments should nonetheless be able to clean out this points source contamination adequately, and quantify the instrumental and algorithmic design specifications required to meet this foreground challenge.},

abstract = {As observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in redshifted 21cm emission begin, we asses the accuracy of the early catalog results from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and the Murchison Widefield Array. The MWA EoR approach derives much of its sensitivity from subtracting foregrounds to <1% precision while the PAPER approach relies on the stability and symmetry of the primary beam. Both require an accurate flux calibration to set the amplitude of the measured power spectrum. The two instruments are very similar in resolution, sensitivity, sky coverage and spectral range and have produced catalogs from nearly contemporaneous data. We use a Bayesian MCMC fitting method to estimate that the two instruments are on the same flux scale to within 20% and find that the images are mostly in good agreement. We then investigate the source of the errors by comparing two overlapping MWA facets where we find that the differences are primarily related to an inaccurate model of the primary beam but also correlated errors in bright sources due to CLEAN. We conclude with suggestions for mitigating and better characterizing these effects.},

Correlations between their spectral peak and angular size strongly suggest that the spectral turnovers are caused by synchrotron self absorption, and indicate that young radio sources evolve in a self similar way. We argue that the evolution of a radio source during its first 105 years is qualitatively very different from that during the rest of its life-time. This may be caused by the difference in the density gradient of the intra-galactic medium inside and outside the core-radius of the host galaxy.},

title = {Observational Constraints on Cosmic Reionization},
abstract = {Observations have set the first constraints on the epoch of reionization (EoR), corresponding to the formation epoch of the first luminous objects. Studies of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption indicate a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from xHI < 10 4 at z ≤ 5.5, to xHI > 10 3, perhaps up to 0.1, at z 6, while the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) implies a significant ionization fraction extending to higher redshifts, z 11 $\pm$ 3. These results, as well as observations of galaxy populations, suggest that reionization is a process that begins as early as z 14, and ends with the "percolation" phase at z 6 to 8. Low luminosity star-forming galaxies are likely the dominant sources of reionizing photons. Future low-frequency radio telescopes will make direct measurements of HI 21-cm emission from the neutral IGM during the EoR, and measurements of secondary CMB temperature anisotropy will provide details of the dynamics of the reionized IGM.},

abstract = {We discuss the possible impact of astrophysical foregrounds on three recent exciting results of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: the WMAP measurements of the temperature-polarization (TE) correlation power spectrum, the detection of CMB polarization fluctuations on degree scales by the DASI experiment, and the excess power on arcminute scales reported by the CBI and BIMA groups. A big contribution from the Galactic synchrotron emission to the TE power spectrum on large angular scales is indeed expected, in the lower frequency WMAP channels, based on current, albeit very uncertain, models; at higher frequencies the rapid decrease of the synchrotron signal may be, to some extent, compensated by polarized dust emission. Recent measurements of polarization properties of extragalactic radio sources at high radio frequency indicate that their contamination of the CMB polarization on degree scales at 30 GHz is substantially below the expected CMB E-mode amplitude. Adding the synchrotron contribution, we estimate that the overall foreground contamination of the signal detected by DASI may be significant but not dominant. The excess power on arc-min scales detected by the BIMA experiment may be due to galactic-scale Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, if the proto-galactic gas is heated to its virial temperature and its cooling time is comparable to the Hubble time at the epoch of galaxy formation. A substantial contamination by radio sources of the signal reported by the CBI group on scales somewhat larger than BIMA's cannot be easily ruled out.},

title = {A Fractal Analysis of the H I Emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud},
abstract = {Fourier transform power spectra of the distribution of neutral hydrogen emission in the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately a power law over ~2 decades in length. Power spectra in the azimuthal direction look about the same as the rectilinear spectra. No difference is seen between power spectra of single-channel maps and power spectra of either the peak emission map or the integrated emission map at the same location. There is a slight steepening of the average one-dimensional and two-dimensional LMC power spectra at high spatial frequencies. Delta-variance methods also show the same power-law structure. These results suggest that most of the interstellar medium in the LMC is fractal, presumably the result of pervasive turbulence, self-gravity, and self-similar stirring. The similarity between the channel and integrated maps suggests they cover about the same line-of-sight depth. The slight steepening of the power spectra at high spatial frequency, corresponding to wavelengths smaller than ~100 pc, could mark the transition from large-scale emission that is relatively shallow on the line of sight to small-scale emission that is relatively thick on the line of sight. Such a transition, if real, would provide a method to obtain the thickness of a face-on galactic gas layer. To check this possibility, three-dimensional fractal models are made from the inverse Fourier transform of noise with a power-law cutoff. The models are viewed in projection with a Gaussian density distribution on the line of sight to represent a face-on galaxy disk with finite disk thickness. The density structure from turbulence is simulated in the models by using a log-normal density distribution function with a scale factor dependent on the Mach number. Additional density structure from simulated H I phase transitions is included in some models. After tuning the Mach number, galaxy thickness, and mathematical form of the phase transition, the models can be made to reproduce the observed LMC power spectra, the amplitude of the H I brightness fluctuations, and the probability distribution function for brightness. In all cases, the H I structure arises from a relatively thin layer in the LMC; the thick part of the H I disk has little spatial structure. The large amplitude of the observed intensity variations cannot be achieved by turbulence alone; phase transitions are required. The character of the fractal H I structure in the LMC is viewed in another way by comparing positive and negative images of the integrated emission. For the isotropic fractal models, these two images have the same general appearance, but for the LMC they differ markedly. The H I is much more filamentary in the LMC than in an isotropic fractal, making the geometric structure of the high-emission regions qualitatively different than the geometric structure of the low-emission (intercloud) regions. The high-emission regions are also more sharply peaked than the low-emission regions, suggesting that compressive events formed the high-emission regions, and expansion events, whether from explosions or turbulence, formed the low-emission regions. The character of the structure is also investigated as a function of scale using unsharp masks and enlargements with four different resolutions. The circular quality of the low-emission regions and the filamentary quality of the high-emission regions is preserved on scales ranging from several tens to several hundreds of parsecs. The spatial scales for sources of turbulent energy input may be illustrated by rms variations in the power spectra with position in the galaxy. This rms decreases from ~0.6 at kpc scales to ~0.25 on ~20 pc scales. The large-scale variations are probably from known supershells. The smaller scale variations could be the result of a combination of turbulent cascades from these large-scale energy inputs and additional energy sources with smaller sizes.},

title = {Radio astronomy polarization measurements},
abstract = {Various polarization measuring schemes are discussed in terms of the Stokes parameters. The methods are separated into three groups according to the number of components isolated by the antenna system. The dispersion resulting from the frequency dependence of the Faraday effect is considered, and the interpretation of polarization data in terms of these effects is discussed. Some results are that one polarization determination will allow limits to be placed on the axial ratio and polarization percentage at the source, and on the ray path integral of longitudinal magnetic field times electron density. A graphical presentation of Hatanaka's dispersion theory permits this to be done very quickly. With suitable assumptions, measurements at two frequencies or with two bandwidths will fix the three quantities. Radio astronomy polarization observations are surveyed. The ionosphere, solar corona, and Crab Nebula are considered briefly in the light of possible Faraday effects. Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker's 3.15-cm observations on the Crab Nebula and the optical results are used to analyze lower frequency attempts to find polarized radiation from this object. },

title = {Star Formation from Galaxies to Globules},
abstract = {Star formation has been found to require a threshold gas surface density in a galaxy disk, and to have a rate that scales with a power law dependence on this surface density once the threshold is exceeded. These large-scale empirical laws suggest that the self-gravity of the gas is important, as if spiral and cloud-forming instabilities are involved. However, the scales for gravitational instabilities are much larger than the scales of individual cloud cores, where most stars form. One wonders how the cores know about the large scale properties of the galaxy around them? Stars also form in a hierarchical fashion on scales ranging from parsecs to kiloparsecs, revealing fractal patterns in young star fields that are similar to the fractal patterns in the gas. Young cluster ages are also correlated with their positions in a manner reminiscent of turbulence. These are different empirical laws, and they suggest that turbulence regulates star-formation instead of gravitational instabilities, which tend to have a characteristic length. This situation is complicated by the common observation that most stars actually form in dense clusters, and that most clusters in the Solar neighborhood were directly triggered by adjacent HII regions. Evidently, there are three unique processes of star formation, and each can independently account for most young stars, depending on how star formation is observed. This talk will address a unifying model in which all of the empirical laws and morphologies can be explained, and it will suggest some important challenges for the future.},

abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope observations in U, B, V, and I passbands of the interacting spiral galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207 are used to measure extinctions in the cloud and intercloud regions and ages and luminosities of the star-forming regions. The extinction in the part of NGC 2207 seen in projection against IC 2163 was determined by using the method of White {\&} Keel. The extinctions there and elsewhere were also determined from radiative transfer models of the magnitude differences between clouds and their surroundings. The intercloud extinction in V band ranges from 0.5 to 1 mag on the line of sight, and the cloud extinction ranges from 1 to 2 mag. The measured star-forming regions in these galaxies have a power-law relation between size and luminosity and a power-law luminosity distribution function. These power laws are consistent with a fractal dimension for the star formation that is the same as that for interstellar gas, D~2.2, extending over scales ranging from 20 to 1000 pc. Fifteen compact massive star clusters that are analogous to super-star clusters found in starburst regions are in the spiral arms of NGC 2207. Nothing is peculiar about these regions except for a high H I velocity dispersion (~50 km s-1). Two more super-star clusters are in the tidally compressed oval of IC 2163. These clusters have masses ranging from ~104 to 2×105 Msolar and ages of a few times 106 yr.},

abstract = {A fundamental assumption of the self-calibration/hybrid mapping techniques, which are in widespread use in aperture synthesis data reduction, is one of isoplanatism: that over any given element of the array, all incident wave fronts, regardless of their directions of arrival, are subject to the same tropospheric/ionospheric path delays. This a poor assumption in the case of a low-frequency array (operating at frequencies lower than approximately 300 MHz), because of the large field of view of such an instrument and because of the wavelength dependence of wave-front perturbation by the ionosphere. The isoplanatism assumption may be relaxed by incorporating an interpolation formula in the solution for antenna/IF phases, and the usual mapping/deconvolution techniques then must be modified in order to cope with space-variant effects. Because of the consequent increase in the number of solution parameters, a better source model, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a larger number of array elements (than are ordinarily required in order to self-calibrate) become desirable.},

title = {The spatial power spectrum of galactic neutral hydrogen from observations of the 21-cm emission line},
abstract = {The authors present a statistical study of the small-scale stucture of interstellar hydrogen based on observations of the power spectrum of its 21 cm brightness distribution. The galactic plane region l = 52$\,^{\circ}$.5, b = 0$\,^{\circ}$.0 is studied with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. Complementary observations were also made, to get information for low spatial frequencies, with the Nan{\c c}ay and Arecibo telescopes. The power spectra were observed over a spatial frequency range of 100 to 6000 wavelengths ((0$\,^{\circ}$.5)-1 to (35arcsec)-1) at Westerbork, and 0 to ≡500 λ at Nan{\c c}ay and Arecibo. The power spectra are apparently independent of position angle in the investigated field and are roughly power laws of the spatial frequencies. The spectral indices are typically ≡-2.0 for single-dish obervations and ≡-3.0 for the Westerbork observation. The spectral indices are found to be independent of H I emission and of velocity, which suggests that the brightness temperature statistics are the same whatever is the hydrogen distance.},

Using data from the MWA 32 antenna prototype, we demonstrate the effectiveness and precision of our new algorithm. Fast Holographic Deconvolution may be particularly important for upcoming 21 cm cosmology observations of the Epoch of Reionization and Dark Energy where foreground subtraction is intimately related to the precision of the data reduction.},

The images are at a resolution of 1.3 arcseconds and an observing wavelength of 6cm, taken at the Cambridge 5km and Very Large Array radio interferometers. In the movie, one can see the overall expansion of the remnant by approximately 1.3 percent, high velocity knots and bow shocks, large filamentary and cellular structures, dark lanes moving across extended emission, and a variety of features evolving in brightness and structure. The velocity structure in the remnant is complex, and the movie allows one to disentangle overlapping features moving at different speeds and directions. Some structures, on both large and small scales, are seen moving backwards, towards the center of the remnant. We will briefly discuss possible physical interpretations of the observed features.

abstract = {A new method of absolute calibration of sky noise temperature using a three-position switched spectrometer, measurements of antenna and low noise amplifier impedance with a vector network analyzer, and ancillary measurements of the amplifier noise waves is described and compared with other methods of calibration. An initial test of the method has been made using brief observations from 55 to 110 MHz at West Forks, Maine, to estimate the sky noise spectral index. Estimates are made of the accuracy that might ultimately be achieved with observations to detect or set limits on the red-shifted 21 cm line at a radio quiet site. It is concluded that an antenna reflection coefficient better than about -20 dB is required to avoid being limited by the accuracy of the antenna reflection coefficient measurements using a vector network analyzer.},

title = {X-ray pre-ionization powered by accretion on the first black holes - II. Cosmological simulations and observational signatures},
abstract = {We use numerical simulations of a cosmological volume to study the X-ray ionization and heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) by an early population of accreting black holes (BHs). By considering theoretical limits on the accretion rate and observational constraints from the X-ray background and faint X-ray source counts, we find that the maximum value of the optical depth to Thompson scattering which can be produced using these models is τe~= 0.17, in agreement with previous semi-analytic results. The redshifted soft X-ray background produced by these early sources is important in producing a fully ionized atomic hydrogen in the low-density intergalactic medium before stellar reionization at redshift z~ 6-7. As a result, stellar re-ionization is characterized by an almost instantaneous `overlap phase' of HII regions. The background also produces a second HeII re-ionization at about redshift 3 and maintains the temperature of the IGM at about 10000K even at low redshifts. If the spectral energy distribution of these sources has a non-negligible high-energy power-law component, the luminosity in the soft X-ray band of the `typical' galaxies hosting intermediate-mass accreting BHs is maximum at z~ 15 and is about one or two orders of magnitude below the sensitivity limit of the Chandra Deep Field. We find that about a thousand of these sources may be present per square arcmin of the sky, producing potentially detectable fluctuations. We also estimate that a few rare objects, not present in our small simulated volume, could be luminous enough to be visible in the Chandra Deep Field. The XEUS and Constellation-X satellites will be able to detect more of these sources that, if radio loud, could be used to study the 21-cm forest in absorption. A signature of an early X-ray pre-ionization is the production of secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies on small angular scales (<1arcmin). We find that in these models the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations increases with decreasing angular scale (ΔT~ 16μK at ~1-arcsec scales), while for stellar re-ionization scenarios the power decreases on smaller scales. We also show that the redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen can be marginally detected in emission at redshifts 7 < z < 12. At a redshift of about z~ 30 a stronger and narrower (in redshift space) signal in absorption against the CMB, that is peculiar to these models, could be detectable.},

title = {Decontamination of cosmological 21-cm maps},
abstract = {We present a method for extracting the expected cosmological 21-cm signal from the epoch of re-ionization, taking into account contaminating radiations and random instrumental noise. The method is based on the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) formalism and employs the coherence of the contaminating radiation along the line-of-sight and the three-dimensional correlations of the cosmological signal. We test the method using a detailed and comprehensive modelling of the cosmological 21-cm signal and the contaminating radiation. The signal is obtained using a high-resolution N-body simulation where the gas is assumed to trace the dark matter and is re-ionized by stellar radiation computed from semi-analytic galaxy formation recipes. We model contaminations to the cosmological signal from synchrotron and free-free galactic foregrounds and extragalactic sources including active galactic nuclei, radio haloes and relics, synchrotron and free-free emission from star-forming galaxies and free-free emission from dark matter haloes and the intergalactic medium. We provide tests of the reconstruction method for several rms values of instrumental noise from σN = 1 to 250mK. For low instrumental noise, the recovered signal, along individual lines-of-sight, fits the true cosmological signal with a mean rms difference of drms ~ 1.7 +/- 0.6 for σN = 1mK, and drms ~ 4.2 +/- 0.4 for σN = 5mK. The one-dimensional power spectrum is nicely reconstructed for all values of σN considered here, while the reconstruction of the two-dimensional power spectrum and the Minkowski functionals is good only for noise levels of the order of few mK.},

title = {Current models of the observable consequences of cosmic reionization and their detectability},
abstract = {A number of large current experiments aim to detect the signatures of the cosmic reionization at redshifts z > 6. Their success depends crucially on understanding the character of the reionization process and its observable consequences and designing the best strategies to use. We use large-scale simulations of cosmic reionization to evaluate the reionization signatures at redshifted 21-cm and small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in the best current model for the background universe, with fundamental cosmological parameters given by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe three-year results. We find that the optimal frequency range for observing the `global step' of the 21-cm emission is 120-150 MHz, while statistical studies should aim at 140-160 MHz, observable by GMRT. Some strongly non-Gaussian brightness features should be detectable at frequencies up to ~190 MHz. In terms of sensitivity-signal trade-off relatively low resolutions, corresponding to beams of at least a few arcminutes, are preferable. The CMB anisotropy signal from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from reionized patches peaks at tens of μK at arcminute scales and has an rms of ~1μK, and should be observable by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We discuss the various observational issues and the uncertainties involved, mostly related to the poorly known reionization parameters and, to a lesser extend, to the uncertainties in the background cosmology.},

title = {Bright Source Subtraction Requirements For Redshifted 21 cm Measurements},
abstract = {The \hi 21 cm transition line is expected to be an important probe into the cosmic dark ages and epoch of reionization. Foreground source removal is one of the principal challenges for the detection of this signal. This paper investigates the extragalactic point source contamination and how accurately bright sources ({\$}\gtrsim 1{\$} ~Jy) must be removed in order to detect 21 cm emission with upcoming radio telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We consider the residual contamination in 21 cm maps and power spectra due to position errors in the sky-model for bright sources, as well as frequency independent calibration errors. We find that a source position accuracy of 0.1 arcsec will suffice for detection of the \hi power spectrum. For calibration errors, 0.05 % accuracy in antenna gain amplitude is required in order to detect the cosmic signal. Both sources of subtraction error produce residuals that are localized to small angular scales, {\$}\kperp \gtrsim 0.05 {\$}Mpc{\$}^{-1}{\$}, in the two-dimensional power spectrum.},

abstract = {Observations of the high-redshift Universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation. Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z˜50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z˜200 to 6.},

title = {Early Observations with The Murchison Widefield Array.},
abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), one of the demonstrator projects for the Square Kilometre Array, is a next-generation radio telescope being built in Australia. The MWA will study cosmological reionization, the sun, space weather, and time variability of the radio sky between 80 and 300 MHz, with construction of the full 512-tile system to be complete by mid 2010. As is the case with other future large low-frequency arrays, the visibility data rate produced is extremely large; the correlator, with 3000 fully-polarized frequency channels, is 20 GB/s (a few Peta-Bytes/day). It is impractical to store data being generated at this rate, and software is currently being developed to calibrate the visibilities and form images from them in real time. Relatively rapid phase and polarization distortions due to the ionosphere set the cadence for the real-time system, with a complete cycle of calibration, imaging and image de-distortion completed every 8 seconds. Furthermore, the gain and polarization response of the antennas need to be measured and accounted for to reach the challenging dynamic range requirements. The software will run on-site on a high-throughput, real-time computing cluster, at several tera-flops. In the second half of 2008 and early 2009, a series of early observations are being carried out at the MWA site with new generation dipoles, beamformers and receivers. A major objective of these site visits will be to gather information on the antenna primary beams, the sky and the ionosphere, as we prepare to commission a sub-array constructed from the first 32 tiles in mid 2009. Data from these observations will also be used for testing of the real-time calibration and imaging system. In this poster we will present results from these early observations, with an emphasis on some of the main technical challenges.},

title = {Cosmological and astrophysical parameter measurements with 21-cm anisotropies during the era of reionization},
abstract = {We study the prospects for extracting cosmological and astrophysical parameters from the low radio frequency 21-cm background due to the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen during and prior to the reionization of the Universe. We make use of the angular power spectrum of 21-cm anisotropies, which exists due to inhomogeneities in the neutral hydrogen density field, the gas temperature field, the gas velocity field, and the spatial distribution of the Lyman-α intensity field associated with first luminous sources that emit UV photons. We extract parameters that describe both the underlying mass power spectrum and the global cosmology, as well as a set of simplified astrophysical parameters that connect fluctuations in the dark matter to those that govern 21-cm fluctuations. We also marginalize over a model for the foregrounds at low radio frequencies. In this general description, we find large degeneracies between cosmological parameters and the astrophysical parameters, though such degeneracies are reduced when strong assumptions are made with respect to the spin temperature relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature or when complicated sources of anisotropy in the brightness temperature are ignored. Some of the degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters are broken when 21-cm anisotropy measurements are combined with information from the CMB, such as the temperature and the polarization measurements with Planck. While the overall improvement on the cosmological parameter estimates is not significant when measurements from first-generation interferometers are combined with Planck, such a combination can measure astrophysical parameters such as the ionization fraction in several redshift bins with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {21-cm tomography is emerging as a promising probe of the cosmological dark ages and the epoch of reionization, as well as a tool for observational cosmology in general. However, serious sources of foreground contamination must be subtracted for experimental efforts to be viable. In this paper, we focus on the removal of unresolved extragalactic point sources with smooth spectra, and evaluate how the residual foreground contamination after cleaning depends on instrumental and algorithmic parameters. A crucial but often ignored complication is that the synthesized beam of an interferometer array shrinks towards higher frequency, causing complicated frequency structure in each sky pixel as `frizz' far from the beam centre contracts across unresolved radio sources. We find that current-generation experiments should none the less be able to clean out this point source contamination adequately, and quantify the instrumental and algorithmic design specifications required to meet this foreground challenge.},

abstract = {We use numerical simulations of cosmic reionization and radiative processes related to the HI 21-cm emission line to produce synthetic radio maps as seen by next-generation telescopes that will operate at low radio frequencies (e.g. the Low Frequency Array, LOFAR). Two different scenarios, in which the end of reionization occurs early (z~ 13) or late (z~ 8) depending on the initial mass function (IMF) of the first stars and ionizing photon escape fraction, have been explored. For each of these models we produce synthetic HI 21-cm emission maps by convolving the simulation outputs with the provisional LOFAR sampling function in the frequency range 76-140 MHz. If reionization occurs late, LOFAR will be able to detect individual HI structures on arcmin scales, emitting at a brightness temperature of ~35 mK as a 3σ signal in about 1000 h of observing time. In the case of early reionization, the detection would be unlikely, due to decreased sensitivity and increased sky temperatures. These results assume that ionospheric, interference and foreground issues are fully under control.},

An external blackbody calibrator provides an {\it in situ} reference. Systematic errors were greatly reduced by using differential radiometers and cooling all critical components to physical temperatures approximating the CMB temperature. A linear model is used to compare the output of each radiometer to a set of thermometers on the instrument. Small corrections are made for the residual emission from the flight train, balloon, atmosphere, and foreground Galactic emission. The ARCADE 2 data alone show an extragalactic rise of {\$}50\pm7{\$} mK at 3.3 GHz in addition to a CMB temperature of {\$}2.730\pm .004{\$} K. Combining the ARCADE 2 data with data from the literature shows a background power law spectrum of {\$}T=1.26\pm 0.09{\$} [K] {\$}(\nu/\nu_0)^{-2.60\pm 0.04}{\$} from 22 MHz to 10 GHz ({\$}\nu_0=1{\$} GHz) in addition to a CMB temperature of {\$}2.725\pm .001{\$} K.},

title = {MAGPIS: A Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey},
abstract = {We present the Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey (MAGPIS), which maps portions of the first Galactic quadrant with an angular resolution, sensitivity, and dynamic range that surpass existing radio images of the Milky Way by more than an order of magnitude. The source detection threshold at 20 cm is in the range 1-2 mJy over the 85% of the survey region (5deg<l<32deg, |b|<0.8d) not covered by bright extended emission; the angular resolution is ~6". We catalog over 3000 discrete sources (diameters mostly <30") and present an atlas of ~400 diffuse emission regions. New and archival data at 90 cm for the whole survey area are also presented. Comparison of our catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space Experiment mid-infrared data allows us to provide preliminary discrimination between thermal and nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability supernova remnant candidates, increasing by a factor of 7 the number of known remnants with diameters smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are pulsar wind nebula candidates and/or very small diameter remnants (D<45''). We report the tentative identification of several hundred H II regions based on a comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial nonthermal emission illustrates the interplay between stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans for follow-up observations and our extension of the survey; when complemented by data from ongoing X-ray and mid-IR observations, we expect MAGPIS to provide an important contribution to our understanding of the birth and death of massive stars in the Milky Way.},

A total of 7644 H II regions are used as indicators of recent star formation. The patchiness of these H II regions is quantified by the fractal dimension. The typical scale length of star formation is deduced by a cluster hierarchy.

title = {Foreground simulations for the LOFAR-epoch of reionization experiment},
abstract = {Future high-redshift 21-cm experiments will suffer from a high degree of contamination, due both to astrophysical foregrounds and to non-astrophysical and instrumental effects. In order to reliably extract the cosmological signal from the observed data, it is essential to understand very well all data components and their influence on the extracted signal. Here we present simulated astrophysical foregrounds data cubes and discuss their possible statistical effects on the data. The foreground maps are produced assuming 5$\,^{\circ}$ × 5$\,^{\circ}$ windows that match those expected to be observed by the LOFAR epoch of reionization (EoR) key science project. We show that with the expected LOFAR-EoR sky and receiver noise levels, which amount to ~52mK at 150 MHz after 400 h of total observing time, a simple polynomial fit allows a statistical reconstruction of the signal. We also show that the polynomial fitting will work for maps with realistic yet idealized instrument response, i.e. a response that includes only a uniform uv coverage as a function of frequency and ignores many other uncertainties. Polarized Galactic synchrotron maps that include internal polarization and a number of Faraday screens along the line of sight are also simulated. The importance of these stems from the fact that the LOFAR instrument, in common with all current interferometric EoR experiments, has an instrumentally polarized response.},

At the same time, there has been rapid progress in resolving a significant fraction of this background with the deep galaxy counts at infrared wavelengths from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) instruments and at submillimeter wavelengths from the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) instrument.

title = {The observed ionization rate of the intergalactic medium and the ionizing emissivity at z >= 5: evidence for a photon-starved and extended epoch of reionization},
abstract = {Galaxies and quasars are thought to provide the bulk of the photons responsible for ionizing the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use a large set of hydrodynamical simulations, combined with measurements of the Lyα opacity of the IGM taken from the literature, to obtain robust estimates of the photoionization rate per hydrogen atom at z = 5 and 6. We find the photoionization rate drops by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively, compared to our recent measurements at z = 2-4. The number of ionizing photons emitted by known sources at z = 5 and 6, based on an extrapolation of source numbers below the detection limit and standard assumptions for the relationship between the ionizing emissivity and observed luminosity density at 1500 {\AA}, are in reasonable agreement with the photoionization rates inferred from the Lyα forest if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is large (>~20 per cent). The expected number of ionizing photons from observed sources at these redshifts therefore appears sufficient to maintain the IGM in its highly ionized state. Claims to the contrary may be attributed to the adoption of an unduly high value for the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen. Using physically motivated assumptions for the mean free path of ionizing photons our measurements of the photoionization rate can be turned into an estimate of the ionizing emissivity. In comoving units the inferred ionizing emissivity is nearly constant over the redshift range 2-6 and corresponds to 1.5-3 photons emitted per hydrogen atom over a time interval corresponding to the age of the Universe at z = 6. This strongly suggests that the epoch of reionization was photon-starved and extended. Completion of reionization at or before z = 6 requires either an emissivity which rises towards higher redshifts or one which remains constant but is dominated by sources with a rather hard spectral index. For standard assumptions, the ionizing emissivity required for completion of reionization at or before z = 6 lies at the upper end of recently reported values from searches for high-redshift galaxies at z = 8-10.},

abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a new low-frequency, wide-field-of-view radio interferometer under development at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia. We have used a 32 element MWA prototype interferometer (MWA-32T) to observe two 50$\,^{\circ}$ diameter fields in the southern sky, covering a total of ~2700 deg2, in order to evaluate the performance of the MWA-32T, to develop techniques for epoch of reionization experiments, and to make measurements of astronomical foregrounds. We developed a calibration and imaging pipeline for the MWA-32T, and used it to produce ~15' angular resolution maps of the two fields in the 110-200 MHz band. We perform a blind source extraction using these confusion-limited images, and detect 655 sources at high significance with an additional 871 lower significance source candidates. We compare these sources with existing low-frequency radio surveys in order to assess the MWA-32T system performance, wide-field analysis algorithms, and catalog quality. Our source catalog is found to agree well with existing low-frequency surveys in these regions of the sky and with statistical distributions of point sources derived from Northern Hemisphere surveys; it represents one of the deepest surveys to date of this sky field in the 110-200 MHz band.},

title = {AGN host galaxies},
abstract = {In this series of four lectures, I discuss four important aspects of AGN host galaxies. In Lecture {\#}1, I address the starburst-AGN connection. First, I briefly review the primary diagnostic tools that are used to quantify and distinguish star formation and nuclear activity. Next I describe the best evidence for a connection between these two processes, first at low luminosity and then at high luminosity. In the last section, I summarize the main results and offer possible explanations. In Lecture {\#}2, I discuss our current understanding of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (log[LIR/L[circle dot operator]]†[greater-or-equal, slanted]†12; ULIRGs). First, I describe the general properties of ULIRGs, comparing the local sample with their distant counterparts. Then I discuss the role of ULIRGs in the formation and evolution of spheroids and their massive black holes. The discussion of their possible role in the metal enrichment of the IGM through superwinds is postponed until Lecture {\#}3. In this third lecture, I discuss the importance of feedback processes in the local and distant universe. The emphasis is on mechanical feedback. I describe the basic physics of winds, a few classic examples of winds in the local universe, the statistical properties of winds, near and far, and their impact on galaxy formation and evolution. A list of potential thesis projects is given at the end. The fourth and final lecture is on elemental abundances as tracers of star formation. First, I explain the basic principles behind chemical evolution, and describe three simple models whose predictions are compared with observations in the Milky Way. Next I discuss and give an interpretation of the results of abundance determinations in local quiescent and starburst galaxies before discussing elemental abundances in the more distant universe.},

title = {The Growth of H II Regions During Reionization},
abstract = {Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM). One of the major outstanding questions is how this event proceeds on large scales. Motivated by numerical simulations, we develop a model for the growth of H II regions during the reionization era. We associate ionized regions with large-scale density fluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size distribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of ionized regions. We show how to construct the power spectrum of fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from the H II regions that should be observable with the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission from the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions beyond the power spectrum and show that our model of reionization qualitatively changes the distribution of neutral gas in the IGM.},

title = {Power Spectrum Sensitivity and the Design of Epoch of Reionization Observatories},
abstract = {Recent theoretical developments for observing the epoch of reionization (EOR) have concentrated on the power spectrum signature of redshifted 21 cm emission. These studies have demonstrated the great potential of statistical EOR observations; however, the sensitivity calculations for proposed low-frequency radio arrays have been highly approximate. The formalism developed for interferometric measurements of the cosmic microwave background can be extended to three dimensions to naturally incorporate the line-of-sight information inherent in the EOR signal. In this paper we demonstrate how to accurately calculate the EOR power spectrum sensitivity of an array and develop scaling relationships that can be used to guide the design of EOR observatories. The implications for antenna distribution, antenna size, and correlator requirements on the EOR sensitivity are detailed.},

title = {Seeing Galaxies through Thick and Thin. III. Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of the Dust in Backlit Spiral Galaxies},
abstract = {We present analysis of Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 imaging of two spiral galaxies partially backlit by elliptical or S0 systems in the pairs AM 1316-241 and AM 0500-620, as well as the (probably spiral) foreground system in NGC 1275. Images in B and I are used to determine the reddening curve of dust in these systems. The foreground spiral component of AM 1316-241 shows dust strongly concentrated in discrete arms, with a reddening law very close to the Milky Way mean [R=AV/E(B-V)=3.4+/-0.2]. The dust distribution is scale-free between about 100 pc and the arm dimension, about 8 kpc. The foreground spiral in AM 0500-620 shows dust concentrated in arms and interarm spurs, with measurable interarm extinction as well. In this case, although the dust properties are less well-determined than in AM 1316-241, we find evidence for a steeper extinction law than the Milky Way mean (formally, R~2.5+/-0.4, with substantial variation depending on data quality in each region). The shape of the reddening law suggests that at least in AM 1316-241 we have resolved most of the dust structure. In AM 0500-620 it is less clear that we have resolved most of the dust structure, since the errors are larger. In AM 0500-620, the slope of the perimeter-scale relation (associated with fractal analysis) steepens systematically when going from regions of low to high extinction. A perimeter-smoothing length test for scale-free (fractal) behavior in AM 1316-241 shows a logarithmic slope typically -0.4 on 100-1000 pc scales. However, we cannot determine a unique fractal dimension from the defining area-perimeter relation, so the projected dust distribution is best defined as fractal-like. For scales above 2-4 pixels (120-250 pc), the box-counting estimate yields a fractal dimension close to 1.4, but the perimeter-area relation yields a dimension of 0.7 on large scales and inconsistent results for small scales, so that the distribution shows only some aspects of a fractal nature. In neither galaxy do we see significant regions, even on single-pixel scales in spiral arms, with AB>2.5. The measurements in NGC 1275 are compromised by our lack of independent knowledge of the foreground system's light distribution, but masked sampling of the absorption suggests an effective reddening curve much flatter than the Milky Way mean (but this may indicate that the foreground system has been affected by immersion in the hot intracluster gas or is inside the stellar distribution of NGC 1275). The bright blue star clusters trace the absorption in this system quite closely, indicating that these clusters belong to the foreground system and not to NGC 1275 itself.

abstract = {Using a set of multifrequency cross spectra computed from the 3 year WMAP sky maps, we fit for the unresolved point-source contribution. For a white-noise power spectrum, we find a Q-band amplitude of A=0.011+/-0.001 μK2 sr (antenna temperature), significantly smaller than the value of 0.017+/-0.002 μK2 sr used to correct the spectra in the WMAP release. Modifying the point-source correction in this way largely resolves the discrepancy that Eriksen et al. found between the WMAP V- and W-band power spectra. Correcting the co-added WMAP spectrum for both the low-l power excess due to a suboptimal likelihood approximation-also reported by Eriksen et al.-and the high-l power deficit due to oversubtracted point sources-presented in this Letter-we find that the net effect in terms of cosmological parameters is an ~0.7 σ shift in ns to larger values. For the combination of WMAP, BOOMERANG, and ACBAR data, we find ns=0.969+/-0.016, lowering the significance of ns≠1 from ~2.7 σ to ~2.0 σ.},

title = {Detecting the Earliest Galaxies through Two New Sources of 21 Centimeter Fluctuations},
abstract = {The first galaxies that formed at a redshift z~20-30 emitted continuum photons with energies between the Lyα and Lyman limit wavelengths of hydrogen, to which the neutral universe was transparent except at the Lyman series resonances. As these photons redshifted or scattered into the Lyα resonance, they coupled the spin temperature of the 21 cm transition of hydrogen to the gas temperature, allowing it to deviate from the microwave background temperature. We show that the fluctuations in the radiation emitted by the first galaxies produced strong fluctuations in the 21 cm flux before the Lyα coupling became saturated. The fluctuations were caused by biased inhomogeneities in the density of galaxies, along with Poisson fluctuations in the number of galaxies. Observing the power spectra of these two sources would probe the number density of the earliest galaxies and the typical mass of their host dark matter halos. The enhanced amplitude of the 21 cm fluctuations from the era of Lyα coupling improves considerably the practical prospects for their detection.},

abstract = {The aimed high sensitivities and large fields of view of the new generation of interferometers impose to reach high dynamic range of order {\$}\sim{\$}1:{\$}10^6{\$} to 1:{\$}10^8{\$} in the case of the Square Kilometer Array. The main problem is the calibration and correction of the Direction Dependent Effects (DDE) that can affect the electro-magnetic field (antenna beams, ionosphere, Faraday rotation, etc.). As shown earlier the A-Projection is a fast and accurate algorithm that can potentially correct for any given DDE in the imaging step. With its very wide field of view, low operating frequency ({\$}\sim30-250{\$} MHz), long baselines, and complex station-dependent beam patterns, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is certainly the most complex SKA precursor. In this paper we present a few implementations of A-Projection applied to LOFAR that can deal with non-unitary station beams and non-diagonal Mueller matrices. The algorithm is designed to correct for all the DDE, including individual antenna, projection of the dipoles on the sky, beam forming and ionospheric effects. We describe a few important algorithmic optimizations related to LOFAR's architecture allowing us to build a fast imager. Based on simulated datasets we show that A-Projection can give dramatic dynamic range improvement for both phased array beams and ionospheric effects. We will use this algorithm for the construction of the deepest extragalactic surveys, comprising hundreds of days of integration.},

title = {Diffuse radio emission from the intracluster medium},
abstract = {An important aspect of the radio emission from galaxy clusters is represented by the diffuse radio sources associated with the intracluster medium: radio halos, relics and mini-halos. The radio halos and relics are indicators of cluster mergers, whereas mini-halos are detected at the center of cooling core clusters. SKA will dramatically improve the knowledge of these sources, thanks to the detection of new objects, and to detailed studies of their spectra and polarized emission. SKA will also provide the opportunity to investigate the presence of halos produced by radiation scattered by a powerful radio galaxy at the cluster centers.},

title = {Constraining the Evolution of the Ionizing Background and the Epoch of Reionization with z~6 Quasars. II. A Sample of 19 Quasars},
abstract = {We study the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic
medium (IGM) at the end of the reionization epoch using
moderate-resolution spectra of a sample of 19 quasars at
5.74<zem<6.42 discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. Three methods are used to trace IGM properties: (1) the
evolution of the Gunn-Peterson (GP) optical depth in the Lyα,
Lyβ, and Lyγ transitions; (2) the distribution of lengths of
dark absorption gaps; and (3) the size of H II regions around luminous
quasars. Using this large sample, we find that the evolution of the
ionization state of the IGM accelerated at z>5.7: the GP optical
depth evolution changes from
τeffGP~(1+z)4.3 to
(1+z)>~11, and the average length of dark gaps with
τ>3.5 increases from <10 to >80 comoving Mpc. The
dispersion of IGM properties along different lines of sight also
increases rapidly, implying fluctuations by a factor of >~4 in the UV
background at z>6, when the mean free path of UV photons is
comparable to the correlation length of the star-forming galaxies that
are thought to have caused reionization. The mean length of dark gaps
shows the most dramatic increase at z~6, as well as the largest
line-of-sight variations. We suggest using dark gap statistics as a
powerful probe of the ionization state of the IGM at yet higher
redshift. The sizes of H II regions around luminous quasars decrease
rapidly toward higher redshift, suggesting that the neutral fraction of
the IGM has increased by a factor of >~10 from z=5.7 to 6.4,
consistent with the value derived from the GP optical depth. The
mass-averaged neutral fraction is 1%-4% at z~6.2 based on the GP optical
depth and H II region size measurements. The observations suggest that
z~6 is the end of the overlapping stage of reionization and are
inconsistent with a mostly neutral IGM at z~6, as indicated by the
finite length of the dark absorption gaps.

Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the
W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership
among the California Institute of Technology, the University of
California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, made
possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation,
with the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the University of Arizona
and the Smithsonian Institution, and with the Kitt Peak National
Observatory 4 m Mayall Telescope.

title = {Subtraction Of Point Sources From Interferometric Radio Images Through An Algebraic Forward Modeling Scheme},
abstract = {Cutting edge cosmological investigations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are driving a renovated effort in building low frequency radio interferometers. In order to detect the tiny EoR signal, high dynamic range (DR) imaging at frequencies below 200 MHz is required. High DR images are traditionally obtained by subtraction of bright sources from the ungridded visibilities, however, future generations of large-N radiotelescopes will generate such high volume data stream that the cost of storing the raw ungridded visibilities will be prohibitive. The DR will therefore be limited by well known pixelization effects. Further challenges for an image based deconvolution at low frequencies are a point spread function which varies significantly across the field of view, a time and frequency variable receptor response and ionospheric variability. In this presentation, we introduce a deconvolution algorithm which makes use of forward modeling to mitigate against the limitations of image-based deconvolution. Through forward modeling it is possible to generate a spatially variable point spread function and relate the sky brightness distribution to astrophysical parameters which are then retrieved through a non linear least squares minimization. We applied the method to the deconvolution of point sources on simulated observations of the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA). MWA is the array with the largest number of correlated elements currently under construction (512 final elements) and will not have the option of storing the raw visibility data over long time integrations. We find that the accuracy to which point sources can be deconvolved/subtracted is only limited by their signal to noise ratio, not by their number or positions, therefore the DR increases with integration time. These results indicate this method to be promising for applications that require high DR imaging, like the detection of the EoR signal.

abstract = {Preliminary results are presented from a simple, single-antenna experiment designed to measure the all-sky radio spectrum between 100 and 200 MHz. The system used an internal comparison-switching scheme to reduce nonsmooth instrumental contaminants in the measured spectrum to 75 mK. From the observations, we place an initial upper limit of 450 mK on the relative brightness temperature of the redshifted 21 cm contribution to the spectrum due to neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization, assuming a rapid transition to a fully ionized IGM at z=8. With refinement, this technique should be able to distinguish between slow and fast reionization scenarios. To constrain the duration of reionization to Δz>2, the systemic residuals in the measured spectrum must be reduced to 3 mK.},

title = {Low-Frequency Gravitational Radiation from Coalescing Massive Black Hole Binaries in Hierarchical Cosmologies},
abstract = {We compute the expected low-frequency gravitational wave signal from coalescing massive black hole (MBH) binaries at the center of galaxies in a hierarchical structure formation scenario in which seed holes of intermediate mass form far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' The merger history of dark matter halos and associated MBHs is followed via cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from redshift z=20 to the present in a ΛCDM cosmology. MBHs get incorporated through halo mergers into larger and larger structures, sink to the center because of dynamical friction against the dark matter background, accrete cold material in the merger remnant, and form MBH binary systems. Stellar dynamical (three-body) interactions cause the hardening of the binary at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii and leads to the final coalescence of the pair. A simple scheme is applied in which the ``loss cone'' is constantly refilled and a constant stellar density core forms because of the ejection of stars by the shrinking binary. The integrated emission from inspiraling MBH binaries at all redshifts is computed in the quadrupole approximation and results in a gravitational wave background (GWB) with a well-defined shape that reflects the different mechanisms driving the late orbital evolution. The characteristic strain spectrum has the standard hc(f)~f-2/3 behavior only in the range f=10-9to10-6 Hz. At lower frequencies the orbital decay of MBH binaries is driven by the ejection of background stars (``gravitational slingshot''), and the strain amplitude increases with frequency, hc(f)~f. In this range the GWB is dominated by 109-1010 Msolar MBH pairs coalescing at 0<~z<~2. At higher frequencies, f>10-6Hz, the strain amplitude, as steep as hc(f)~f-1.3, is shaped by the convolution of last stable circular orbit emission by lighter binaries (102-107 Msolar) populating galaxy halos at all redshifts. We discuss the observability of inspiraling MBH binaries by a low-frequency gravitational wave experiment such as the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Over a 3 yr observing period LISA should resolve this GWB into discrete sources, detecting ~60 (~250) individual events above an S/N=5 (S/N=1) confidence level.},

abstract = {This paper is the second in a series describing the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) being carried out at 843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). The survey will consist of ~590 4.3$\,^{\circ}$× 4.3$\,^{\circ}$ mosaic images with 45 × 45 cosec|δ| arcsec2 resolution, and a source catalogue. In this paper we describe the initial release (version 1.0) of the source catalogue consisting of 107 765 radio sources made by fitting elliptical Gaussians in 271 SUMSS 4.3$\,^{\circ}$× 4.3$\,^{\circ}$ mosaics to a limiting peak brightness of 6 mJy beam-1 at δ<=-50$\,^{\circ}$ and 10 mJy beam-1 at δ > -50$\,^{\circ}$. The catalogue covers approximately 3500 deg2 of the southern sky with δ<=-30$\,^{\circ}$, about 43 per cent of the total survey area. Positions in the catalogue are accurate to within 1-2 arcsec for sources with peak brightness A843>= 20 mJy beam-1 and are always better than 10 arcsec. The internal flux density scale is accurate to within 3 per cent. Image artefacts have been classified using a decision tree, which correctly identifies and rejects spurious sources in over 96 per cent of cases. Analysis of the catalogue shows that it is highly uniform and is complete to 8 mJy at δ<=-50$\,^{\circ}$ and 18 mJy at δ > -50$\,^{\circ}$. In this release of the catalogue about 7000 sources are found in the overlap region with the National Radio Astronomy Observatories Very Large Array Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz. We calculate a median spectral index of α=-0.83 between 1.4 GHz and 843 MHz. This version of the catalogue will be released via the World Wide Web with future updates as new mosaics are released.},

title = {Subtraction of point sources from interferometric radio images through an algebraic forward modelling scheme},
abstract = {We present a method for subtracting point sources from interferometric radio images via forward modelling of the instrument response and involving an algebraic non-linear minimization. The method is applied to simulated maps of the Murchison Wide-field Array but is generally useful in cases where only image data are available. After source subtraction, the residual maps have no statistical difference to the expected thermal noise distribution at all angular scales, indicating high effectiveness in the subtraction. Simulations indicate that the errors in recovering the source parameters decrease with increasing signal-to-noise ratio, which is consistent with the theoretical measurement errors. In applying the technique to simulated snapshot observations with the Murchison Wide-field Array, we found that all 101 sources present in the simulation were recovered with an average position error of 10 arcsec and an average flux density error of 0.15 per cent. This led to a dynamic range increase of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. Since all the sources were deconvolved jointly, the subtraction was not limited by source sidelobes but by thermal noise. This technique is a promising deconvolution method for upcoming radio arrays with a huge number of elements and a candidate for the difficult task of subtracting foreground sources from observations of the 21-cm neutral hydrogen signal from the epoch of reionization.},

title = {Breaking the hierarchy of galaxy formation},
abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z > 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z ~ 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z ~ 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

title = {Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Likelihoods and Parameters from the WMAP Data},
abstract = {This paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of WMAP data alone. A simple ΛCDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic parameters of the model are consistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: Ω b h 2 = 0.02273 $\pm$ 0.00062, Ω c h 2 = 0.1099 $\pm$ 0.0062, ΩΛ = 0.742 $\pm$ 0.030, ns = 0.963+0.014 -0.015, τ = 0.087 $\pm$ 0.017, and σ8 = 0.796 $\pm$ 0.036, with h = 0.719+0.026 -0.027. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, τ>0, at 5σ significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z reion = 11.0 $\pm$ 1.4 with 68% confidence. The 2σ lower limit is z reion > 8.2, and the 3σ limit is z reion > 6.7. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z = 6 at more than 3.5σ significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to the foreground treatment of τ ~ 0.01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We find evidence for the first time in the CMB power spectrum for a nonzero cosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with the standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit ΛCDM model with N eff = 0 at >99.5% confidence, and N eff > 2.3(95%confidence limit (CL)) when varied. The five-year WMAP data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r < 0.43(95%CL), for power-law models, and halve the limit on r for models with a running index, r < 0.58(95%CL). With longer integration we find no evidence for a running spectral index, with dns /dln k = -0.037 $\pm$ 0.028, and find improved limits on isocurvature fluctuations. The current WMAP-only limit on the sum of the neutrino masses is {\Sigma}m ν < 1.3 eV(95%CL), which is robust, to within 10%, to a varying tensor amplitude, running spectral index, or dark energy equation of state.

title = {The simulated 21 cm signal during the Epoch of Reionization: full modelization of the Ly-alpha pumping},
abstract = {The 21 cm emission of HI is the most promising probe of the epoch of reionization (EoR). In the next few years, the SKA pathfinders will provide statistical measurements of this signal. Numerical simulations predicting these observations are necessary to optimize the design of the instruments and help in the interpretation of the data. Simulations are reaching a reasonable level in terms of scale range, but are still often relying on simplifications to compute the strength of the signal. The main difficulty is the computation of the spin temperature of HI which depends on the gas kinetic temperature and the level of the local Ly-alpha flux (Wouthuysen-Field effect). A T_S >> T_CMB assumption is usual. However, this assumption does not apply early or even later in the reionization history if the sources of ionizing radiation are stars (and not quasars). This work presents the first EoR numerical simulations including, beside dynamics and ionizing continuum radiative transfer, a self-consistent treatment of the Ly-alpha radiative transfer, which allows us to compute the spin temperature accurately. We use two different box sizes, 20 h^-1 Mpc and 100 h^-1 Mpc, and a star source model. Using the redshift dependence of average quantities, maps, and power spectra, we quantify the effect of using different assumptions to compute the spin temperature and the influence of the box size. We find that the biggest effect comes from allowing for a signal in absorption: indeed regions seen in absorption survive (with our source model) almost until the end of reionization. The influence of using the real, local, Ly-alpha flux is important for an average ionization fraction smaller than ~10%: it changes the overall amplitude of the signal, and adds its own fluctuations to the power spectrum.},

title = {Imaging the Epoch of Reionization: Limitations from Foreground Confusion and Imaging Algorithms},
abstract = {Tomography of redshifted 21 cm transition from neutral hydrogen using Fourier synthesis telescopes is a promising tool to study the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Limiting the confusion from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds is critical to the success of these telescopes. The instrumental response or the point-spread function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently three dimensional with frequency mapping to the line-of-sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will necessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists; therefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so that the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper aims to understand the three-dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the same framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination along frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship between foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on the Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground contamination---"PSF contamination" and "gridding contamination." We show that PSF contamination is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there potentially exists an "EoR window" with negligible foreground contamination where we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. PSF contamination in this window may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window function. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional gridding contamination and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z Transform that significantly reduces this contamination. Finally, we demonstrate the analytical relationships and the merit of the new imaging algorithm for the case of imaging with the Murchison Widefield Array.},

title = {Precision calibration of radio interferometers using redundant baselines},
abstract = {Growing interest in 21-cm tomography has led to the design and construction of broad-band radio interferometers with low noise, moderate angular resolution, high spectral resolution and wide fields of view. With characteristics somewhat different from traditional radio instruments, these interferometers may require new calibration techniques in order to reach their design sensitivities. Self-calibration or redundant calibration techniques that allow an instrument to be calibrated off complicated sky emission structures are ideal. In particular, the large number of redundant baselines possessed by these new instruments makes redundant calibration an especially attractive option. In this paper, we explore the errors and biases in existing redundant calibration schemes through simulations, and show how statistical biases can be eliminated. We also develop a general calibration formalism that includes both redundant baseline methods and basic point source calibration methods as special cases, and show how slight deviations from perfect redundancy and coplanarity can be taken into account.},

title = {Radio Astronomical Probes of Cosmic Reionization and the First Luminous Sources: Probing the 'Twilight Zone'},
abstract = {The epoch of reionization (EoR) corresponds to a 'cosmic phase transition', when the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes ionized by the first stars and/or AGN. While the discoveries of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs in the spectra of the highest redshift QSOs and large scale polarization of the CMB have set the first hard constraints on the EoR, the redshift and process of reionization, and the nature of the first luminous objects, remain two of the paramount questions in cosmic structure formation. Moreover, the GP effect is such that observations of objects during this epoch will be difficult at wavelengths shorter than about 1 micron. Hence, cosmic reionization, and the formation of the first luminous objects, occurs in a 'twilight zone', observable only at radio through near-IR wavelengths. In this talk I explore studies of the EoR at meter through sub-millimeter wavelengths. I present recent observations of the dust, molecular gas, and star formation activity in the host galaxies of the highest redshift QSOs. These results have interesting implications on the timescale for metal and dust enrichment, on the possibility of coeval formation of super massive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxies, and on the process of reionization. I then discuss future capabilities of low frequency radio astronomy to study the neutral IGM via the H I 21 cm line, including imaging and power spectral analyses of large scale structure in emission, and absorption studies toward the first radio loud sources. I conclude with a summary of the VLA-VHF system to study cosmic Stromgren spheres associated with the highest redshift SDSS QSOs in the H I 21 cm line at 190 MHz.},

title = {Understanding radio polarimetry. II. Instrumental calibration of an interferometer array.},
abstract = {In a companion paper, a mathematical formalism to describe the polarimetric response of a radio interferometer was presented. Some of the instrumental parameters, however, are either unknown or poorly known. Here we consider the determination of these parameters both by a traditional radio-interferometry instrumental approach as well as by using optical polarimetry principles. In doing so, we establish links between the two fields. We show that some degrees of freedom cannot be solved for with various calibration or self-calibration schemes. These degrees of freedom are identified with instrumental parameters and physical source properties. The number of unsolvable degrees of freedom is reduced for a long synthesis with alt-az antennas. We also consider the effect of errors in the assumed instrumental parameters on the resultant calibrated data. The polarimetric calibration procedure for some telescopes is reviewed in the context of this analysis.},

title = {The Gravitational Wave Signal from Massive Black Hole Binaries and Its Contribution to the LISA Data Stream},
abstract = {Massive black hole binaries, with masses in the range 103-108 Msolar, are expected to be the most powerful sources of gravitational radiation at mHz frequencies, and hence are among the primary targets for the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We extend and refine our previous analysis, detailing the gravitational wave signal expected from a cosmological population of massive black hole binaries. As done in our previous paper, we follow the merger history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the massive black holes they host, and their growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences in a ΛCDM cosmology. Stellar dynamical processes dominates the orbital evolution of black hole binaries at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii, causing the final coalescence of the pairs. We show that the GW signal from this population, in a 3 yr LISA observation, will be resolved into ~=90 discrete events with S/N>=5, among which ~=35 will be observed above threshold until coalescence. These ``merging events'' involve relatively massive binaries, M~105 Msolar, in the redshift range 2<~z<~6. The remaining ~=55 events come from higher redshift, less massive binaries (M~5×103 Msolar at z>~6) and, although their S/N integrated over the duration of the observation can be substantial, the final coalescence phase is at too high a frequency to be directly observable by space-based interferometeres such as LISA. LISA will be able to detect a fraction >~90% of all the coalescences of massive black hole binaries occurring at z<~5. The residual confusion noise from unresolved massive black hole binaries is expected to be at least an order of magnitude below the estimated stochastic noise.},

title = {The nature and evolution of the highly ionized near-zones in the absorption spectra of z ~= 6 quasars},
abstract = {We use state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations combined with a one-dimensional radiative transfer code to assess the extent to which the highly ionized regions observed close to z ~= 6 quasars, which we refer to as near-zones, can constrain the ionization state of the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). We find the appearance in Lyα absorption of a quasar HII ionization front expanding into a neutral IGM can be very similar to a classical proximity zone, produced by the enhancement in ionizing flux close to a quasar embedded in a highly ionized IGM. The observed sizes of these highly ionized near-zones and their redshift evolution can be reproduced for a wide range of IGM neutral hydrogen fractions for plausible values of the luminosity and lifetime of the quasars. The observed near-zone sizes at the highest observed redshifts are equally consistent with a significantly neutral and a highly ionized surrounding IGM. Stronger constraints on the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction can be obtained by considering the relative size of the near-zones in the Lyα and Lyβ regions of a quasar spectrum. A large sample of high-quality quasar absorption spectra with accurate determinations of near-zone sizes and their redshift evolution in both the Lyα and Lyβ regions should confirm or exclude the possibility that the Universe is predominantly neutral at the highest observed redshifts. The width of the discrete absorption features in these near-zones will contain important additional information on the ionization state and the previous thermal history of the IGM at these redshifts.},

abstract = {Techniques to improve the data quality of interferometric radio observations are considered. Fundaments of fringe frequencies in the uv-plane are discussed and filters are used to attenuate radio-frequency interference (RFI) and off-axis sources. Several new applications of filters are introduced and tested. A low-pass filter in the time and frequency directions on single baseline data is successfully used to lower the noise in the area of interest and to remove sidelobes coming from unmodelled off-axis sources and RFI. Related side effects of data integration, averaging and gridding are analysed, and shown to be able to cause ghosts and an increase in noise, especially when using long baselines or interferometric elements that have a large field of view. A novel projected fringe low-pass filter is shown to be potentially useful for first-order source separation. Initial tests show that the filters can be several factors faster compared to common source separation techniques such as peeling and a variant of peeling that is currently being tested for the Low-Frequency Array called 'demixed peeling'. Further testing is required to support the performance of the filters.},

abstract = {QUASARS have been found up to redshifts of almost five, corresponding to an epoch when the Universe was less than ten per cent of its present age. This leaves a rather short time for the formation of the galaxies in which quasars are believed to be embedded. Indeed, some optical studies1-3 indicate that the space density of quasars does decline rapidly for redshifts z > 3, as expected if this is the epoch of galaxy formation. The interpretation of this decline is equivocal, however, as it could result simply from the obscuration of distant quasars by dust in intervening galaxies4. Radio emission from quasars, on the other hand, is unaffected by dust, and we show here that the space density of radio-loud quasars also decreases strongly forz > 3, demonstrating that the decline is real, at least for these objects. We argue that this conclusion probably applies to all quasars. If quasars are associated with galaxy formation and/or interactions between galaxies, the decline in their space density at high redshift provides a measure of the timescale for the onset of these processes.},

title = {The Theory and Simulation of the 21-cm Background from the Epoch of Reionization},
abstract = {The redshifted 21-cm line of distant neutral H atoms provides a probe of the cosmic ``dark ages'' and the epoch of reionization (``EOR'') which ended them, within the first billion years of cosmic time. The radio continuum produced by this redshifted line can be seen in absorption or emission against the cosmic microwave background (``CMB'') at meterwaves, yielding information about the thermal and ionization history of the universe and the primordial density perturbation spectrum that led to galaxy and large-scale structure formation. Observing this 21-cm background is a great challenge, as it is necessary to detect a diffuse signal at a brightness temperature that differs from that of the CMB at millikelvin levels and distinguish this from foreground continuum sources. A new generation of low-frequency radio arrays is currently under development to search for this background. Accurate theoretical predictions of the spectrum and anisotropy of this background, necessary to guide and interpret future observations, are also quite challenging. Toward this end, it is necessary to model the inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalactic medium and determine the spin temperature of the 21-cm transition and its variations in time and space as it decouples from the temperature of the CMB. In my talk, I summarized some of the theoretical progress in this area. Here, I will focus on just a few of the predictions for the 21-cm background from the EOR, based on our newest, large-scale simulations of patchy reionization. These simulations are the first with enough N-body particles (from 5 to 29 billion) and radiative transfer rays to resolve the formation of and trace the ionizing radiation from each of the millions of dwarf galaxies believed responsible for reionization, down to 108 Msolar, in a cubic volume large enough (90 and 163 comoving Mpc on a side) to make meaningful statistical predictions of the fluctuating 21-cm background.},

title = {Self-Calibration in the Ska: Dealing with Inherently Strong Instrumental Polarization},
abstract = {The polarization properties of a phased-array SKA will depart radically from those we are familiar with. The E- and H-plane beams of a linear or planar dipole are very different and the primary beam formed by arrays of such dipoles is strongly polarized. The customary quasi-scalar description is inadequate: Polarization must be accounted for in a fundamental way. Once this is done, we must investigate whether or not a phased-array SKA will in principle be capable of achievements comparable to those of conventional synthesis arrays. Selfcal is crucial to these achievements. In this paper I address the vital question of its viability in the presence of arbitrary instrumental polarization. I introduce an interferometer description based on 2x2 matrices. I then propose a matrix-based self-calibration method that is entirely analogous to the scalar one. I show that the standard selfcal assumptions suppress spatial scattering in matrix selfcal like they do in scalar selfcal: Thus the basic condition for obtaining images with a high dynamic range is satisfied. However, matrix selfcal alone cannot guarantee the polarimetric fidelity of the image: It introduces an unknown polrotation of the Stokes (Q,U,V) brightness vector and an unknown polconversion between unpolarized and polarized brightness. Methods similar to those currently applied in quasi-scalar polarimetry must be applied to reduce these poldistorsions to an acceptable level.},

title = {Constraining Gravitational and Cosmological Parameters with Astrophysical Data},
abstract = {We use astrophysical data to shed light on fundamental physics by constraining parametrized theoretical cosmological and gravitational models. Gravitational parameters are those constants that parametrize possible departures from Einstein's general theory of relativity. We develop a general framework to describe torsion in the spacetime around the Earth, and show that certain observables of the Gravity Probe B experiment can be computed in this framework. We also search for viable theories of gravity where the Ricci scalar R in the Lagrangian is replaced by an arbitrary function f(R). Making use of the equivalence between such theories and scalar-tensor gravity, we find that models can be made consistent with solar system constraints either by giving the scalar a high mass or by exploiting the so-called Chameleon Effect. Cosmology can successfully describe the evolution of our universe using six or more adjustable cosmological parameters. There is growing interest in using 3-dimensional neutral hydrogen mapping with the redshifted 21 cm line as a cosmological probe. We quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We present an accurate and robust method for measuring cosmological parameters that exploits the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather smooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters. We find that a future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography could have great potential, improving the sensitivity to spatial curvature and neutrino masses by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0.0002 and Delta-m_nu ~ 0.007 eV, and giving a 4 sigma detection of the spectral index running predicted by the simplest inflation models.},

title = {Foregrounds for Future 21cm Observations at High Redshift},
abstract = {Recent theoretical studies suggest that observation of the neutral hydrogen 21cm transition at high redshift may open up a window to structure formation in the early universe. Neutral hydrogen gas produces signals during the ``Dark Ages" prior to the reionization of the intergalactic medium by the first bright sources. These signals may be detectable with the next generation of radio telescopes, such as LOFAR (the Low-Frequency Array) and SKA (the Square Kilometer Array), and may be sought either as brightness fluctuations across an area of the sky, or as signatures in the spectra of distant sources. We present the preliminary findings of a study of confusing foregrounds for both types of observation, focusing on galactic and extragalactic radio recombination lines, free-free emission, and synchrotron radiation. We also discuss modeling and the prospects for observing the 21cm transition in mini-halos at high redshift.

abstract = {The emission of 21 cm radiation from a neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift is discussed in connection with the thermal and ionization history of the universe. The physical mechanisms that make such radiation detectable against the cosmic microwave background include Lyα coupling of the hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas and preheating of the IGM by the first generation of stars and quasars. Three different signatures are investigated in detail: (a) the fluctuations in the redshifted 21 cm emission induced by the gas density inhomogeneities that develop at early times in cold dark matter (CDM) dominated cosmologies, (b) the sharp absorption feature in the radio sky due to the rapid rise of the Lyα continuum background that marks the birth of the first UV sources in the universe, and (c) the 21 cm emission and absorption shells that are generated on several Mpc scales around the first bright quasars. Future radio observations with projected facilities like the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Square Kilometer Array may shed light on the power spectrum of density fluctuations at z>5 and map the end of the ``dark ages,'' i.e., the transition from the postrecombination universe to one populated with radiation sources.},

title = {The spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution and 21-cm line profile of dark-age gas},
abstract = {The 21-cm hyperfine line of atomic hydrogen (HI) is a promising probe of the cosmic dark ages. In past treatments of 21-cm radiation it was assumed the hyperfine level populations of HI could be characterized by a velocity-independent `spin temperature' Ts determined by a competition between 21-cm radiative transitions, spin-changing collisions, and (at lower redshifts) Lyα scattering. However we show here that, if the collisional time is comparable to the radiative time, the spin temperature will depend on atomic velocity, Ts = Ts(v), and one must replace the usual hyperfine level rate equations with a Boltzmann equation describing the spin and velocity dependence of the HI distribution function. We construct here the Boltzmann equation relevant to the cosmic dark ages and solve it using a basis-function method. Accounting for the actual spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution results in up to a ~2 per cent suppression of the 21-cm emissivity, and a redshift and angular-projection-dependent suppression or enhancement of the linear power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations of up to ~5 per cent. The effect on the 21-cm line profile is more dramatic - its full width at half-maximum can be enhanced by up to ~60 per cent relative to the velocity-independent calculation. We discuss the implications for 21-cm tomography of the dark ages.},

title = {Cosmological H II Bubble Growth during Reionization},
abstract = {We present general properties of ionized hydrogen (H II) bubbles and their growth based on a state-of-the-art, large-scale (100 Mpc h-1) cosmological radiative transfer simulation. The simulation resolves all halos with atomic cooling at the relevant redshifts and simultaneously performs radiative transfer and dynamical evolution of structure formation. Our major conclusions include the following: (1) For significant H II bubbles, the number distribution is peaked at a volume of ~0.6 Mpc3 h-3 at all redshifts. But at z<=10, one large, connected network of bubbles dominates the entire H II volume. (2) H II bubbles are highly nonspherical. (3) The H II regions are highly biased with respect to the underlying matter distribution, with the bias decreasing with time. (4) The non-Gaussianity of the H II region is small when the universe becomes 50% ionized. The non-Gaussianity reaches its maximum near the end of the reionization epoch z~6. But at all redshifts of interest there is a significant non-Gaussianity in the H II field. (5) Population III galaxies may play a significant role in the reionization process. Small bubbles are initially largely produced by Population III stars. At z>=10 even the largest H II bubbles have a balanced ionizing photon contribution from Population II and Population III stars, while at z<=8 Population II stars start to dominate the overall ionizing photon production for large bubbles, although Population III stars continue to make a nonnegligible contribution. (6) The relationship between halo number density and bubble size is complicated, but a strong correlation is found between halo number density and bubble size for large bubbles.},

title = {21 Centimeter Fluctuations from Cosmic Gas at High Redshifts},
abstract = {The relatively large Thomson optical depth, τes, inferred recently from the WMAP observations suggests that the universe was reionized in a more complex manner than previously believed. However, the value of τes provides only an integral constraint on the history of reionization and, by itself, cannot be used to determine the nature of the sources responsible for this transition. Here we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21 cm radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical description of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a formalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both frequency and angular scale. Prior to and following reionization, fluctuations in the 21 cm signal are mediated by density perturbations in the distribution of matter. Between these epochs, pockets of gas surrounding luminous objects become ionized, producing large H II regions. These ``bubbles'' of ionized material imprint features into the 21 cm power spectrum that make it possible to distinguish them from fluctuations produced by the density perturbations. The variation of the power spectrum with frequency can be used to infer the evolution of this process. As has been emphasized previously by others, the absolute 21 cm signal from neutral gas at high redshifts is difficult to detect as a result of contamination by foreground sources. However, we argue that this source of noise can be suppressed by comparing maps closely spaced in frequency, i.e., redshift, so that 21 cm fluctuations from the IGM can be measured against a much brighter, but smoothly varying (in frequency), background.},

title = {A Flux Scale for Southern Hemisphere 21 cm Epoch of Reionization Experiments},
abstract = {We present a catalog of spectral measurements covering a 100-200 MHz band for 32 sources, derived from observations with a 64 antenna deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. For transit telescopes such as PAPER, calibration of the primary beam is a difficult endeavor and errors in this calibration are a major source of error in the determination of source spectra. In order to decrease our reliance on an accurate beam calibration, we focus on calibrating sources in a narrow declination range from --46$\,^{\circ}$ to --40$\,^{\circ}$. Since sources at similar declinations follow nearly identical paths through the primary beam, this restriction greatly reduces errors associated with beam calibration, yielding a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of derived source spectra. Extrapolating from higher frequency catalogs, we derive the flux scale using a Monte Carlo fit across multiple sources that includes uncertainty from both catalog and measurement errors. Fitting spectral models to catalog data and these new PAPER measurements, we derive new flux models for Pictor A and 31 other sources at nearby declinations; 90% are found to confirm and refine a power-law model for flux density. Of particular importance is the new Pictor A flux model, which is accurate to 1.4% and shows that between 100 MHz and 2 GHz, in contrast with previous models, the spectrum of Pictor A is consistent with a single power law given by a flux at 150 MHz of 382 $\pm$ 5.4 Jy and a spectral index of --0.76 $\pm$ 0.01. This accuracy represents an order of magnitude improvement over previous measurements in this band and is limited by the uncertainty in the catalog measurements used to estimate the absolute flux scale. The simplicity and improved accuracy of Pictor A's spectrum make it an excellent calibrator in a band important for experiments seeking to measure 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization.},

abstract = {Attempts of Magain et al. to detect the host galaxy of the bright quasi-stellar object (QSO) HE0450-2958 have not been successful. We suggest that the supermassive black hole (SMBH) powering the QSO was ejected from the observed ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) at the same redshift and at 1.5 arcsec distance. Ejection could have been caused either by recoil due to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of SMBHs or the gravitational slingshot of three or more SMBHs in the ongoing merger of galaxies which triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG. We discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up of SMBHs from intermediate and/or stellar mass black holes, and for the detection of coalescing supermassive binary black holes by LISA.},

title = {HST Observations of Fractal Dust Structure in the Central Kiloparsec of Spiral Galaxies},
abstract = {We examined the dust morphology in the central kiloparsec of 20 normal and active galaxies in order to look for pressure-driven waves that are predicted to dominate over density waves when gaseous self-gravity is weak. Such acoustic waves may provide a mechanism for the transport of material into active centers of nonbarred galaxies. Our sample includes nonbarred Seyfert 1, Seyfert 2, and LINER galaxies, plus normal galaxies of the same early Hubble types. These galaxies represent about one-fourth of the galaxies examined; the others showed primarily a two-arm dust structure in the nuclear regions. The size distribution of the dust structures in these 20 galaxies was examined with unsharp masks and Gaussian smoothing. The distribution function was found to be a power law with about the same slope in each galaxy, suggesting universal fractal structure reminiscent of pressure-driven turbulence.

title = {Bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble: 21 cm measurements of the high-redshift universe},
abstract = {I review the potential insights to be gained from 21 cm measurements of the high-redshift universe. At the highest redshifts (z ˜ 30 150), the gas appears in absorption against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) because collisions drive the spin temperature TS below the CMB temperature TCMB. In this epoch, 21 cm fluctuations trace the matter power spectrum and its growth history. At z < 30, collisions become inefficient and TS → TCMB. However, hot collapsed minihalos and proto-filaments in the cosmic web appear in emission, allowing us to trace the beginnings of structure formation. Once the first luminous objects appear, they flood the universe with Lyα photons. Fluctuations in the radiation field induce 21 cm fluctuations through variations in the coupling between the spin and kinetic temperatures of the gas. The temperature fluctuations saturate once the radiation background becomes substantial and X-rays have efficiently heated the universe. During this reionization era the 21 cm signal traces the gas density and the ionization field. The resulting fluctuations will offer enormous insight into the nature of the sources driving reionization and their interactions with the intergalactic medium.},

title = {The complex nature of the ISM in the SMC: an HI and infrared study},
abstract = {This thesis presents the results of a combination of new observations with the Parkes telescope of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with an Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) aperture synthesis mosaic. The new data consists of a set of images sensitive to all angular (spatial) scales between 98 arcsec (30 pc) and 4o (4 kpc). The data are used to study the HI distribution and mass, the velocity field and rotation curve of the SMC, as well as to probe the 3-D structure of the SMC. A kinematic study of the HI data reveals the existence of three supergiant shells which were previously undetectable in the ATCA data alone. The HI spatial power spectrum has been investigated over a range of contiguous scale sizes wider than those previously achieved in any other galaxy, including our own. It closely obeys the relation, P(k)∝ kγ, suggesting an alternative model for the interstellar medium (ISM) of the SMC, having fractal nature and consisting of a hierarchy of HI cloud structures. This thesis also demonstrates that the infrared data obtained with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) for the SMC can be successfully reconstructed with much higher resolution using the Pyramid Maximum Entropy algorithm. The new infrared (IR) data are used to study the integrated IR spectrum, the dust temperature and dust column density in the SMC. The high resolution HI and IR data enable an investigation of the spatial correlation of dust and gas and the assumption of the dust and gas being well-mixed in the ISM. The spatial power spectrum of the dust column density shows that, as with the HI power spectrum, there is no preferred scale size for dust clouds. The remarkable similarity of the spatial power spectra for the HI and dust column density distributions suggests a unique and ubiquitous hierarchical structure organisation for the ISM in the SMC. Such an organisation is likely to be governed by the Kolmogorov type turbulence and could be described by the fractal nature with the volume fractal dimension of 2.4.},

abstract = {Based on high resolution cosmological N-body simulations, we track the hierarchical growth of black holes in galaxy clusters from z=8 to z=0. We present a census of black holes as function of redshift and determine their mass assembly history under a variety of assumptions regarding the importance of gas accretion in black hole growth, from early supercritical Eddington accretion to gas-poor hierarchical assembly. Following a galaxy merger, black holes are expected to form, inspiral and merge after strongly radiating energy via gravitational waves. For each binary black hole inspiral and merger, we determine the expected gravitational wave signal for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and calculate the LISA event rate as a function of time. Since we calculate the black hole mass assembly history for several black hole growth scenerios, we can explore tests to characterize each model observationally. In particular, we discuss how well LISA observations will be able to distinguish between these very different assembly scenerios.},

title = {Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms},
abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

abstract = {Using high-resolution N-body simulations in LambdaCDM universe, we have constructed dark matter structure's merger tree that traces evolution of dark matter halos, their subhalos and massive black holes (MBH) formed from Population III stars. Such early black holes, formed at redshifts z > 10, could be the seed black holes for the many SMBH found in galaxies in the local universe. Mergers of MBH may be a prime signal for long wavelength gravitaional wave detectors. We study trajectories of MBH, formation of MBH binaries and calculate gravitational strain amplitude as a function of redshift. We also explore the implications of kick velocities conjectured by some formation models. The central concentration of early black holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they are born even with moderate kicks of tens km/s. The modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the lower mass black holes as compared to those still embedded in their parent halos. Therefore, merger rates may be reduced by more then an order of magnitude. We quantify the role of kicks on black hole merger rates. Our results also apply to black holes ejected by the gravitational slingshot mechanism.},

abstract = {We present a new technique for calibrating the primary beam of a wide-field, drift-scanning antenna element. Drift-scan observing is not compatible with standard beam calibration routines, and the situation is further complicated by difficult-to-parameterize beam shapes and, at low frequencies, the sparsity of accurate source spectra to use as calibrators. We overcome these challenges by building up an interrelated network of source "crossing points"---locations where the primary beam is sampled by multiple sources. Using the single assumption that a beam has 180$\,^{\circ}$ rotational symmetry, we can achieve significant beam coverage with only a few tens of sources. The resulting network of crossing points allows us to solve for both a beam model and source flux densities referenced to a single calibrator source, circumventing the need for a large sample of well-characterized calibrators. We illustrate the method with actual and simulated observations from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization.},

abstract = {We study the impact of inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization on the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) using hydrodynamic + radiative transfer simulations where reionization is completed either early (z~9) or late (z~6). In general, we find that low-density gas near large-scale overdensities is ionized and heated earlier than gas in the large-scale, underdense voids. Furthermore, at a later time the IGM temperature is inversely related to the reionization redshift because gas that is heated earlier has more time to cool through adiabatic expansion and Compton scattering. Thus, at the end of reionization the median temperature-density relation is an inverted power law with slope γ-1~-0.2, in both models. However, at fixed density there is up to order unity scatter in the temperature due to the distribution of reionization redshifts. Because of the complex equation of state, the evolved IGM temperature-density relations for the redshift range 4<~z<~6 can still have significant curvature and scatter. These features must be taken into account when interpreting the Lyα absorption in high-redshift quasar spectra.},

abstract = {The 7C survey of radio sources is being made with the Cambridge Low-Frequency Synthesis Telescope at 151 MHz, with an angular resolution of 70 x 70 cosec δ arcsec^2^. We present the results from one part of of this survey covering 0.144 sr in two areas of sky centred at RA 10^h^ 2S^m^, Dec. 41^deg^ and RA 06^h^ 28^m^, Dec. 45^deg^ and reaching a limiting flux density of 50 mJy. A list of the positions, flux densities and angular sizes of 4723 sources is presented; the position errors are in the range 1-3 arcsec for sources with flux densities greater than 500 mJy, and the flux density errors are typically 18 mJy. About 10 per cent of the sources have apparent angular sizes greater than 60 arcsec. The derived source counts are as accurate as those presently available at 405 and 1400 MHz and show similar behaviour; in particular the convergence slopes are the same. The median spectral index between 151 and 408 MHz remains constant at ~0.9 between 10 and 0.5 Jy at 151 MHz.},

title = {Measuring and calibrating galactic synchrotron emission},
abstract = {Our position inside the Galaxy requires all-sky surveys to reveal its large-scale properties. The zero-level calibration of all-sky surveys differs from standard `relative' measurements, where a source is measured in respect to its surroundings. All-sky surveys aim to include emission structures of all angular scales exceeding their angular resolution including isotropic emission components. Synchrotron radiation is the dominating emission process in the Galaxy up to frequencies of a few GHz, where numerous ground based surveys of the total intensity up to 1.4 GHz exist. Its polarization properties were just recently mapped for the entire sky at 1.4 GHz. All-sky total intensity and linear polarization maps from WMAP for frequencies of 23 GHz and higher became available and complement existing sky maps. Galactic plane surveys have higher angular resolution using large single-dish or synthesis telescopes. Polarized diffuse emission shows structures with no relation to total intensity emission resulting from Faraday rotation effects in the interstellar medium. The interpretation of these polarization structures critically depends on a correct setting of the absolute zero-level in Stokes U and Q.},

title = {Discovery of Faint Radio Structures over 50 Square Degrees Down to 3 arcmin Scales near the NGP},
abstract = {We present a deep, 8o diameter, 0.4 GHz radio image near the North Galactic Pole using a first time combination of the Arecibo 305-m telescope and the wide-angle interferometer at the DRAO. The uniquely complementary nature of these two instruments permits a distortion-free image sensitive to radiation on all scales from 8o down to that of an individual galaxy halo at the 100 Mpc distance of the Great Wall, all in a single pointing. Faint, previously unseen diffuse patches of distributed radio ``glow'' are detected, well above our detection limit, and on a range of angular scales. The emission could compete with CMB fluctuations as a CMB foreground at high multipole scales around 30GHz <u>if</u> its radio spectrum continues up to these GHz bands. This new faint radio emission appears to be a mix of foreground Galactic, and extragalactic ``glow'. The latter implies i.g. magnetic field strengths at or above 0.1 microgauss on Mpc scales in certain areas. A striking anticorrelation is also found between the diffuse radio glow and some regions of high optical galaxy surface density. This suggests that cosmological Large Scale Structure (LSS), normally defined by the baryonic (and/or dark) matter density, is not uniquely traced by the faint continuum radio glow. More likely, the radio glow is a proxy for IGM energy density, at least in the low redshift universe. Its detailed relation to the WHIM, and diffuse X-ray glow is unclear, and must await future, more sensitive detectors for these latter two IGM components. Support for this project is acknowledged from the DOE's LDRD program at LANL, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the National Science Foundation.},

title = {Probing the first stars and black holes in the early Universe with the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE)},
abstract = {A concept for a new space-based cosmology mission called the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) is presented in this paper. DARE's science objectives include: (1) When did the first stars form? (2) When did the first accreting black holes form? (3) When did Reionization begin? (4) What surprises does the end of the Dark Ages hold (e.g., Dark Matter decay)? DARE will use the highly-redshifted hyperfine 21-cm transition from neutral hydrogen to track the formation of the first luminous objects by their impact on the intergalactic medium during the end of the Dark Ages and during Cosmic Dawn (redshifts z = 11-35). It will measure the sky-averaged spin temperature of neutral hydrogen at the unexplored epoch 80-420 million years after the Big Bang, providing the first evidence of the earliest stars and galaxies to illuminate the cosmos and testing our models of galaxy formation. DARE's approach is to measure the expected spectral features in the sky-averaged, redshifted 21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40-120 MHz. DARE orbits the Moon for a mission lifetime of 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside, the only location in the inner solar system proven to be free of human-generated radio frequency interference and any significant ionosphere. The science instrument is composed of a low frequency radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, bi-conical dipole antennas, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and the differential spectral calibration approach using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique will be applied to detect the weak cosmic 21-cm signal in the presence of the intense solar system and Galactic foreground emissions.},

The frequency dependence of the synthesized beam implies that the sidelobes of these sources will move across the field of view as a function of observing frequency, hence frustrating line-of-sight foreground subtraction techniques. We describe a method for subtracting these point sources from dirty maps produced by an instrument such as the MWA. This technique combines matched filters with an iterative centroiding scheme to locate and characterize point sources in the presence of a diffuse background. Simulations show that this technique can improve the dynamic range of epoch-of-reionization maps by 2-3 orders of magnitude.},

title = {Radio Foregrounds for the 21 Centimeter Tomography of the Neutral Intergalactic Medium at High Redshifts},
abstract = {Absorption or emission against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation may be observed in the redshifted 21 cm line if the spin temperature of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) prior to reionization differs from the CMB temperature. This so-called 21 cm tomography should reveal important information on the physical state of the IGM at high redshifts. The fluctuations in the redshifted 21 cm line, due to gas density inhomogeneities at early times, should be observed at meter wavelengths by the next-generation radio telescopes such as the proposed Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Here we show that the extragalactic radio sources provide a serious contamination to the brightness temperature fluctuations expected in the redshifted 21 cm emission from the IGM at high redshifts. Unless the radio source population cuts off at flux levels above the planned sensitivity of SKA, its clustering noise component will dominate the angular fluctuations in the 21 cm signal. The integrated foreground signal is smooth in frequency space, and it should nonetheless be possible to identify the sharp spectral feature arising from the nonuniformities in the neutral hydrogen density during the epoch when the first UV sources reionize the IGM.},

title = {Radio Survey Of Snrs In The Inner Galaxy},
abstract = {We report the discovery of up to 35 new supernova remnants (SNRs) from a 42" resolution 90cm multi-configuration Very Large Array survey of the Galactic plane covering 4.5 deg < l < 22.0 deg and |b| < 1.25 deg. Archival 20cm, 11cm, and 8 micron data have also been used to identify the SNRs and constrain their properties. The 90cm image is sensitive to SNRs with diameters 2.5' to 50' and down to a surface brightness limit of 10-21 W m-2 Hz-1 sr-1. This survey has nearly tripled the number of SNRs known in this part of the Galaxy, and represents an overall 15% increase in the total number of Galactic SNRs. These results suggest that further deep low frequency surveys of the inner Galaxy will solve the discrepancy between the expected number of Galactic SNRs and the significantly smaller number of currently known SNRs.The National Radio Astronomy Observatory operates the Very Large Array and is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under a cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.

abstract = {The accurate and precise removal of 21-cm foregrounds from Epoch of Reionization (EoR) redshifted 21-cm emission data is essential if we are to gain insight into an unexplored cosmological era. We apply a non-parametric technique, Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (gmca), to simulated Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-EoR data and show that it has the ability to clean the foregrounds with high accuracy. We recover the 21-cm 1D, 2D and 3D power spectra with high accuracy across an impressive range of frequencies and scales. We show that gmca preserves the 21-cm phase information, especially when the smallest spatial scale data is discarded. While it has been shown that LOFAR-EoR image recovery is theoretically possible using image smoothing, we add that wavelet decomposition is an efficient way of recovering 21-cm signal maps to the same or greater order of accuracy with more flexibility. By comparing the gmca output residual maps (equal to the noise, 21-cm signal and any foreground fitting errors) with the 21-cm maps at one frequency and discarding the smaller wavelet scale information, we find a correlation coefficient of 0.689, compared to 0.588 for the equivalently smoothed image. Considering only the pixels in a central patch covering 50 per cent of the total map area, these coefficients improve to 0.905 and 0.605, respectively, and we conclude that wavelet decomposition is a significantly more powerful method to denoise reconstructed 21-cm maps than smoothing.},

title = {Self-calibration of arrays whose elements are strongly polarized},
abstract = {Traditional calibration methods based on scalar self- calibration rely on a linearized quasi-scalar approximation. Several underlying assumptions will no longer hold for the phased-array telescopes being considered in this conference. The reason is that the element antennas will show a strong instrumental polarization, that is moreover strongly dependent on the pointing of the array. Scalar selfcal cannot be used for calibrating such an array. This paper offers a rigorous description, based upon 2 X 2 matrices, that fully accounts for polarization phenomena in an interferometer. It then translates the traditional selfcal algorithm into this matrix language by exploiting the analogies between scalar and matrix multiplications. It is shown that the matrix algorithm does not yield a complete calibration: It only aligns all antenna- based error by suppressing the scattering of radiation away from source components to places in the image that should be empty. In doing so, it satisfies the requirement for a high dynamic range. However, it admits an unknown uniform in-place transformation, the poldistortion, of the matrix brightness. In terms of Stokes brightness parameters, the polvector (Q,U,V) in Stokes-vector space is rotated in an unknown way and there is an unknown mutual polconversion between Stokes I and the polvector. One must eliminate this poldistortion to make the image a faithful rendition of the source. Unpolarized sources can be used as calibrators to suppress the polconversion effect, after which prior statistical knowledge about the orientations and ellipticities of the antenna elements serves to eliminate most of the polrotation, much in the same way as in the quasi-scalar method. For homogeneous arrays of identical elements, one supplementary phase measurement of some sort is required; for heterogeneous arrays this is not even necessary. In the absence of unpolarized calibrators, polconversion must be eliminated by other means. There are no obvious ways of achieving this: Developing suitable calibration techniques will be a major challenge for the new generation of telescopes. In the concluding section, the consequences of my findings for the design of phased-array aperture-synthesis telescopes are explored.},

abstract = {We incorporate a model for black hole growth during galaxy mergers into the semi-analytical galaxy formation model based on ΛCDM proposed by Baugh et al. Our black hole model has one free parameter, which we set by matching the observed zero-point of the local correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity. We present predictions for the evolution with redshift of the relationships between black hole mass and bulge properties. Our simulations reproduce the evolution of the optical luminosity function of quasars. We study the demographics of the black hole population and address the issue of how black holes acquire their mass. We find that the direct accretion of cold gas during starbursts is an important growth mechanism for lower mass black holes and at high redshift. On the other hand, the re-assembly of pre-existing black hole mass into larger units via merging dominates the growth of more massive black holes at low redshift. This prediction could be tested by future gravitational wave experiments. As redshift decreases, progressively less massive black holes have the highest fractional growth rates, in line with recent claims of `downsizing' in quasar activity.},

title = {Measuring the Redshift of Reionization with a Modest Array of Low-Frequency Dipoles},
abstract = {The designs of the first generation of cosmological 21-cm observatories are split between a low-cost single dipole which integrates over the entire sky in order to find the global (spectral) signature of reionization, and interferometers with arcminute-scale angular resolution whose goal is to measure the 3D power spectrum of ionized regions during reionization. We examine whether intermediate scale instruments such as MWA 32T are capable of placing new constraints on reionization. We find that the global redshift of reionization can be measured from the variance in the 21-cm signal among multiple beams on large angular scales as a function of frequency, instead of the conventional approach of measuring the entire 21-cm power spectrum. The beam-to-beam variance in the differential brightness temperature peaks when the average neutral fraction was > 50%, providing a convenient flag of zreion. A low angular resolution of order 1 degree is needed to exploit the physical size of the ionized regions and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Thermal noise, foregrounds, and instrumental effects should be manageable, as long as the uv (Fourier) coverage is complete within the compact core required for low-resolution imaging. We find that zreion can potentially be detected to within a redshift uncertainty of 1 or better in 500 or more hours of integration on the existing MWA prototype (with only 32x16 dipoles), operating at an angular resolution of roughly 1 degree and a spectral resolution of 2.4 MHz. The prospects for such a detection are generic to similar 21-cm observatories (e.g., LOFAR) that have good uv coverage after earth-rotation synthesis for baselines corresponding to > roughly 1 degree.},

title = {Fractal Structure in Interstellar Clouds: Implications for the Intercloud Medium and Diffuse Hα , Halo Ionization, and the Mass Distribution of Star Clusters},
abstract = {The fractal dimension of interstellar gas has been measured to be D ~ 2.3 from the size distribution of molecular clouds (Elmegreen {\&} Falgarone ApJ Nov 10 1996). This is about the same as the fractal dimension of structure seen in laboratory turbulence and is a strong indication that most interstellar clouds form by processes related to turbulence. The mass spectrum of interstellar clouds and the mass-size correlation also follow from this fractal structure. Models of D=2.3 fractals show an open structure with a high fraction of the volume at very low density. Thus the same turbulence that makes the clouds can also produce much of the low density intercloud medium without requiring hot gas or overlapping supernovae. Fractal structure around clouds leads to extensive low density envelopes around HII regions, and can account for most of the diffuse ionized gas in galactic disks. Diffuse clouds should be clustered together, along with very small-scale neutral gas structure, giving an average mean free path between fractal cloud complexes equal to ~ 300 pc for an overall average of 8 standard clouds per kiloparsec. Considering also the holes in each fractal cloud, the mean path length of low-density gas can be as large as 600 pc, making possible the ionization of the galactic halo from leaky disk HII regions. Fractal clouds have a mass distribution close to M(-2) , and can therefore account for the common formation of young stars in clusters, which have the same mass distribution. Indeed, new data on the cluster mass spectrum in the Large Magellanic Clouds, and models for the evolution of the halo globular cluster mass spectrum, suggest that all clusters, including open clusters, young disk globular clusters, and old halo globular clusters, form by the same basic mechanism in turbulent gas (Elmegreen {\&} Efremov 1997 ApJ, in press).},

title = {Testing the Topology of Reionization},
abstract = {The central overlap phase of cosmological hydrogen reionization is fundamentally a change in the topology of ionized regions. Before overlap, ionized bubbles grew in isolation. During overlap, they merge into a percolating ionized medium, which fills an ever-increasing volume and eventually replaces neutral gas throughout the intergalactic medium. Overlap can therefore be well studied using topological statistics, and in particular the genus number of the neutral-ionized interface. The most promising observational tools for applying such tests are (a) Lyman alpha galaxies, and (b) 21 cm tomography. Lyman alpha galaxies will be detected whenever they inhabit bubbles larger than 1 physical Mpc, and their presence can therefore be used to map such bubbles. Such large bubbles are expected during the overlap phase, and moreover, each one should contain a few detectably bright Lyman alpha galaxies. The 21cm line in principle affords better spatial resolution, but the required sensitivity and foreground subtraction may be an issue. Upcoming Lyman alpha surveys in the near-infrared could thus provide our first look at the topology of reionization.},

title = {LISA data analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods},
abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to simultaneously detect many thousands of low-frequency gravitational wave signals. This presents a data analysis challenge that is very different to the one encountered in ground based gravitational wave astronomy. LISA data analysis requires the identification of individual signals from a data stream containing an unknown number of overlapping signals. Because of the signal overlaps, a global fit to all the signals has to be performed in order to avoid biasing the solution. However, performing such a global fit requires the exploration of an enormous parameter space with a dimension upwards of 50 000. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods offer a very promising solution to the LISA data analysis problem. MCMC algorithms are able to efficiently explore large parameter spaces, simultaneously providing parameter estimates, error analysis, and even model selection. Here we present the first application of MCMC methods to simulated LISA data and demonstrate the great potential of the MCMC approach. Our implementation uses a generalized F-statistic to evaluate the likelihoods, and simulated annealing to speed convergence of the Markov chains. As a final step we supercool the chains to extract maximum likelihood estimates, and estimates of the Bayes factors for competing models. We find that the MCMC approach is able to correctly identify the number of signals present, extract the source parameters, and return error estimates consistent with Fisher information matrix predictions.},

To complete our study of radio polarimetry, we examine here the definition of the Stokes parameters adopted by Commission 40 of the IAU (1974) and the way this definition works out in the mathematical equations. Using the formalism of Paper I, we give a simplified derivation of the frequently-cited `black-box' formula originally derived by Morris et al. (1964). We show that their original version is in error in the sign of Stokes V, the correct sign being that given by Weiler (1973) and Thompson et al. (1986).},

abstract = {The possible contributions of the various classes of extragalactic sources (including, in addition to the canonical radio sources, GHz Peaked Spectrum sources, advection-dominated sources, starburst galaxies, high-redshift proto-spheroidal galaxies) to the arcminute scale fluctuations measured by the CBI, BIMA, and ACBAR experiments are discussed. At 30 GHz, fluctuations due to radio sources undetected by ancillary low-frequency surveys may be higher than estimated by the CBI and BIMA groups. High-redshift dusty galaxies, whose fluctuations may be strongly enhanced by the effect of clustering, could contribute to the BIMA excess signal, and dominate at 150 GHz (the ACBAR frequency). Moreover, in the present data situation, the dust emission of these high-redshift sources set an unavoidable limit to the detection of primordial CMB anisotropies at high multipoles, even at frequencies as low as ≃ 30 GHz. It is concluded that the possibility that the excess power at high multipoles is dominated by unsubtracted extragalactic sources cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, there is room for a contribution from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect within clusters of galaxies, with a density fluctuation amplitude parameter σ8 consistent with the values preferred by current data.},

We have constructed data pipelines from the time-ordered raw visibility samples to the CMB power spectra that utilize the methods of data compression, maximum likelihood analysis, and optimal subspace filtering. They are customized for three observational strategies: the single pointing, the mosaicking, and the drift-scanning. For each strategy, derived are the optimal strategy parameters that yield band power estimates with minimum uncertainty. The results are general and can be applied to any close-packed array on a single platform such as the CBI and the forthcoming AMiBA experiments. We have also studied the effect of rotation of the array platform on the band power correlation by simulating the CBI single-pointing observation. It is found that the band power anticorrelations can be reduced by rotating the platform and thus densely sampling the visibility plane. This enables us to increase the resolution of the power spectrum in the l-space down to the limit of the sampling theorem (Δl=226~π/θ), which is narrower by a factor of about sqrt(2) than the resolution limit (Δl~300) used in the recent CBI single-pointing observation. The validity of this idea is demonstrated for a two-element interferometer that samples visibilities uniformly in the uv-annulus. From the fact that the visibilities are the Fourier modes of the CMB field convolved with the beam, a fast unbiased estimator (FUE) of the CMB power spectra is developed and tested. It is shown that the FUE gives results very close to those from the quadratic estimator method without requiring large computer resources even though uncertainties in the results increase.},

If history is any example, the excitement of the SKA will not be in the old questions which are answered, but the new questions that will be raised by the new types of observations it will permit. The SKA is a tool for as-yet-unborn users and there is an onus on its designers to allow for the exploration of the unknown. We outline a philosophy for the design and operation of the SKA that can lead the radio astronomers in the 21st century to add to the many discoveries of new phenomena made by radio astronomers in the 20th century.},

title = {Simulating polarized Galactic synchrotron emission at all frequencies. The Hammurabi code},
abstract = {Context: Galactic synchrotron emission, rotation measure (RM), and the deflection of ultra-high-energy-cosmic-rays (UHECR) permit detailed studies of the Galactic magnetized inter-stellar-medium (ISM). The synchrotron emission has also to be characterized properly to enable its distinction from other astrophysically interesting signals such as the CMB. Aims: We present a publicly available code called hammurabi for generating mock, polarized observations of Galactic synchrotron emission with telescopes such as LOFAR, SKA, Planck, and WMAP, based on model inputs for the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), the cosmic-ray density distribution, and the thermal electron density. We also present mock UHECR deflection measure (UDM) maps based on model inputs for the GMF. In future, when UHECR sources are identified, this will allow us to use UDM as a probe of GMF in a way similar to how polarized radio sources enable us to define rotation measures. Methods: To demonstrate the code's abilities, mock observations are compared with real data. This allows us to constrain the input parameters of our simulations with a focus on large-scale magnetic field properties. Results: Magnetized ISM models in the literature appear to be unable to reproduce any additional observational data not included in their design. Conclusions: As expected, attempts to model the synchrotron, UHECR-deflection, and RM input parameters indicate that any additional observational data set significantly increases the constraints on the models. The hammurabi code addresses this by allowing one to perform simulations of several different data sets simultaneously, providing a more reliable constraint of the magnetized ISM.},

title = {Initial deep LOFAR observations of epoch of reionization windows. I. The north celestial pole},
abstract = {Aims: The aim of the LOFAR epoch of reionization (EoR) project is to detect the spectral fluctuations of the redshifted HI 21 cm signal. This signal is weaker by several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals and hence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibration for stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. Methods: One of the prospective observing windows for the LOFAR EoR project will be centered at the north celestial pole (NCP). We present results from observations of the NCP window using the LOFAR highband antenna (HBA) array in the frequency range 115 MHz to 163 MHz. The data were obtained in April 2011 during the commissioning phase of LOFAR. We used baselines up to about 30 km. The data was processed using a dedicated processing pipeline which is an enhanced version of the standard LOFAR processing pipeline. Results: With about 3 nights, of 6 h each, effective integration we have achieved a noise level of about 100 μJy/PSF in the NCP window. Close to the NCP, the noise level increases to about 180 μJy/PSF, mainly due to additional contamination from unsubtracted nearby sources. We estimate that in our best night, we have reached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by the noise from our Galaxy and the receivers. Our continuum images are several times deeper than have been achieved previously using the WSRT and GMRT arrays. We derive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to be mainly due to sources at large angular separation from the NCP. We present some details of the data processing challenges and how we solved them. Conclusions: Although many LOFAR stations were, at the time of the observations, in a still poorly calibrated state we have seen no artefacts in our images which would prevent us from producing deeper images in much longer integrations on the NCP window which are about to commence. The limitations present in our current results are mainly due to sidelobe noise from the large number of distant sources, as well as errors related to station beam variations and rapid ionospheric phase fluctuations acting on bright sources. We are confident that we can improve our results with refined processing.},

title = {21 Centimeter Tomography of the Intergalactic Medium at High Redshift},
abstract = {We investigate the 21 cm signature that may arise from the intergalactic medium (IGM) prior to the epoch of full reionization (z > 5). In scenarios in which the IGM is reionized by discrete sources of photoionizing radiation, the neutral gas that has not yet been engulfed by an H II region may easily be preheated to temperatures well above that of the cosmic background radiation (CBR), rendering the IGM invisible in absorption against the CBR. We identify three possible preheating mechanisms: (1) photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from QSOs, (2) photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from early galactic halos, and (3) resonant scattering of the continuum UV radiation from an early generation of stars. We find that bright quasars with only a small fraction of the observed comoving density at z ~ 4 will suffice to preheat the entire universe at z >~ 6. We also show that, in a cold dark matter dominated cosmology, the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation associated with collapsing galactic mass halos (1010--1011 M{\.o}) may warm the IGM to ~100 K by z ~ 7. Alternatively, the equivalent of ~10% of the star formation rate density in the local universe, whether in isolated pregalactic stars, dwarf, or normal galaxies, would be capable of heating the entire IGM to a temperature above that of the CBR by Ly alpha scattering in a small fraction of the Hubble time at z ~ 6. In the presence of a sufficiently strong ambient flux of Ly alpha photons, the hyperfine transition in the warmed H I will be excited. A beam differencing experiment would detect a patchwork of emission, both in frequency and in angle across the sky. This patchwork could serve as a valuable tool for understanding the epoch, nature, and sources of the reionization of the universe, and their implications for cosmology. We demonstrate that isolated QSOs will produce detectable signals at meter wavelengths within their "spheres of influence" over which they warm the IGM. As a result of the redshifted 21 cm radiation emitted by warm H I bubbles, the spectrum of the radio extragalactic background will display frequency structure with velocity widths up to 10,000 km s-1. Broad beam observations would reveal corresponding angular fluctuations in the sky intensity with delta T/T <~ 10-3 on scales theta ~ 1 deg. This scale is set either by the "thermalization distance" from a QSO within which Ly alpha pumping determines the spin temperature of the IGM or by the quasar lifetime. Radio measurements near 235 and 150 MHz, as will be possible in the near future using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, may provide the first detection of a neutral IGM at 5 <~ z <~ 10. A next generation facility like the Square Kilometer Array Interferometer could effectively open much of the universe to a direct study of the reheating epoch and possibly probe the transition from a neutral universe to one that is fully ionized.},

title = {How accurately can 21cm tomography constrain cosmology?},
abstract = {There is growing interest in using 3-dimensional neutral hydrogen mapping with the redshifted 21 cm line as a cosmological probe. However, its utility depends on many assumptions. To aid experimental planning and design, we quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions, focusing on the 21 cm signal from 6<z<20. We cover assumptions related to modeling of the ionization power spectrum, to the experimental specifications like array layout and detector noise, to uncertainties in the reionization history, and to the level of contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We derive simple analytic estimates for how various assumptions affect an experiment's sensitivity, and we find that the modeling of reionization is the most important, followed by the array layout. We present an accurate yet robust method for measuring cosmological parameters that exploits the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather smooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters. We find that for future experiments, marginalizing over these nuisance parameters may provide constraints almost as tight on the cosmology as if 21 cm tomography measured the matter power spectrum directly. A future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography could improve the sensitivity to spatial curvature and neutrino masses by up to 2 orders of magnitude, to ΔΩk≈0.0002 and Δmν≈0.007eV, and give a 4σ detection of the spectral index running predicted by the simplest inflation models.},

title = {Observations of the Sun with the 32 Element MWA Prototype},
abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a low frequency (80-300 MHz) interferometric radio array currently under construction in the remote and radio quiet Western Australian outback. A prototype array comprising 32 elements, known as the 32 tile system (32T), has been built on site as an end-to-end test-bed for integration and performance testing of the hardware, firmware and software components. The 32T system also provides an opportunity to obtain early scientific observations. We present the first calibrated brightness temperature synthesis images of the quiet Sun at 5 frequencies between 85 and 235 MHz using MWA 32T. This frequency range is expected to correspond to emission from the 1 million Kelvin plasma in the lower corona. The MWA design is well suited for observations of the large scale coronal structure, and the unexpectedly deep and long lived solar minimum during which these observations were taken make them especially interesting. We compare our observations with expectations from the generally accepted coronal models and flux densities obtained from other sources and conclude that, despite there being broad agreement between the observations and predictions, closer examination shows some differences. Further observations are planned in order to understand this in greater detail and to continue to characterize the large scale temperature structure of the corona at regular intervals as activity begins in the new solar cycle. This research was part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Haystack Observatory.},

title = {Systematic effects of foreground removal in 21-cm surveys of reionization},
abstract = {21-cm observations have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the high-redshift Universe. Whilst extremely bright radio continuum foregrounds exist at these frequencies, their spectral smoothness can be exploited to allow efficient foreground subtraction. It is well known that - regardless of other instrumental effects - this removes power on scales comparable to the survey bandwidth. We investigate associated systematic biases. We show that removing line-of-sight fluctuations on large scales aliases into suppression of the 3D power spectrum across a broad range of scales. This bias can be dealt with by correctly marginalizing over small wavenumbers in the 1D power spectrum; however, the unbiased estimator will have unavoidably larger variance. We also show that Gaussian realizations of the power spectrum permit accurate and extremely rapid Monte Carlo simulations for error analysis; repeated realizations of the fully non-Gaussian field are unnecessary. We perform Monte Carlo maximum likelihood simulations of foreground removal which yield unbiased, minimum variance estimates of the power spectrum in agreement with Fisher matrix estimates. Foreground removal also distorts the 21-cm probability distribution function (PDF), reducing the contrast between neutral and ionized regions, with potentially serious consequences for efforts to extract information from the PDF. We show that it is the subtraction of large-scale modes which is responsible for this distortion, and that it is less severe in the earlier stages of reionization. It can be reduced by using larger bandwidths. In the late stages of reionization, identification of the largest ionized regions (which consist of foreground emission only) provides calibration points which potentially allow recovery of large-scale modes. Finally, we also show that (i) the broad frequency response of synchrotron and free-free emission will smear out any features in the electron momentum distribution and ensure spectrally smooth foregrounds and (ii) extragalactic radio recombination lines should be negligible foregrounds.},

Fortunately, the imahe may be stabilized for long integrations by using bright radio sources in the sky. The downside is that LOFAR fields will be very crowded, which presents calibration challenges of its own. This is especially true for the bright and extended sources that enter via the relatively high sidelobes of the LOFAR station beams. An extra complication is that these beamshapes vary rather strongly in frequency and time. Altogether, LOFAR will require much more processing than existing radio telescopes, and has only just become possible with the new generation of computers. Even so, new processing techniques like 'peeling' had to be developed to speed things up by several orders of magnitude.},

title = {Catalogues from a deep 327 MHz Westerbork Survey (Wieringa 1991,1993)},
abstract = {We present the results of a deep survey of six fields with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at 327 MHz. In total we have detected ~4500 sources brighter than our 5-sigma noise level, which ranges from 2.4-3.5 mJy/beam, over an area of ~95 square degrees. For four fields we also obtained 608 MHz observations, for the remaining two fields 608 MHz observations were already available. We present the source catalogues at both frequencies and derive source counts and spectral indices. The data were calibrated using the DWARF redundancy package and absolute calibration is based on 3C286, using a flux of 26.93 Jy at 327 Mhz and 21.47 Jy at 608 MHz. The source parameters were determined using a gaussian fitting procedure for all but the most complex sources and statistical corrections for noise bias were applied. As part of my PhD-thesis at Leiden Observatory I made the following surveys at 327 and 608 MHz using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope: ------------------------------------------------------------------------- - 64W2: Lynx, 327 MHz only (this field has been mapped at this frequency before by M.J.A. Oort (thesis), I've added a 2 after the W to indicate the revised list), numbers do not correspond because the present survey is more sensitive. 69W : Draco, a survey of 2 overlapping fields at 327 MHz and 6 fields at 608 MHz. 70W : Umi, 327 MHz only, one field. 75W : OH471, one 327 MHz field and three 608 MHz fields 76W : Cam, one 327 MHz field and three 608 MHz fields ------------------------------------------------------------------------- - Sources detected at both frequencies have corresponding numbers in the 327 MHz (92cm) and 608 MHz (50cm) lists. Multiple sources are indicated by a '*' after the name, their components by 'A','B', etc. Components of multiple sources do not necessarily correspond between the two frequencies, also in some cases one or more components may not be detected at the other frequency.

title = {All-sky analysis of polarization in the microwave background},
abstract = {Using the formalism of spin-weighted functions we present an all-sky analysis of polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin +/-2 spherical harmonics. These are the analogues of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin +/-2 multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receive contributions from scalar modes and does not cross correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit expressions for scalar and tensor modes in the form of line of sight integral solution and numerically evaluate them for a representative set of models. These general solutions differ from the expressions obtained previously in the small scale limit both for scalar and tensor modes. A method to generate and analyze all-sky maps of temperature and polarization is given and the optimal estimators for various power spectra and their corresponding variances are discussed.},

title = {SPECFIND Catalog of radio continuum spectra (Vollmer+ 2005)},
abstract = {SPECFIND is a new tool to extract cross-identifications and radio continuum spectra from radio catalogues contained in the VIZIER database of the CDS. It is designed to handle radio surveys of very different resolutions and sensitivities. Power laws are fitted to the radio spectra, resulting in the determination of a power law slope and a zero-point. SPECFIND has been applied to 22 survey catalogues at 11 different frequencies (159 - 8400 MHz) containing a total of 3.5 million sources, leading to 757894 independent radio cross-identifications and 66866 independent radio spectra with more than two independent frequencies. The code was tested and its results validated by a comparison between the spectral indices found by SPECFIND and those determined by other authors. The determined spectral indices have an error of about +/-0.3. Negative spectral indices have smaller errors, while the error of positive spectral indices can be larger, mainly because of the occurrence of a peak in the spectrum. The code is quite rapid (less than 3 hr running time on a standard PC for 3.5 million sources) and since it is written in C, it can be run on virtually all PCs with at least 512~MB RAM. It produces an output of variable format that can be adapted easily to the purpose of the user. The results of the spectrum identification process are provided as a master table, where a spectrum is attached to each radio source. Due to the SPECFIND algorithm, different radio components of the same physical source can have somewhat different slopes and zero-points. The SPECFIND subdirectory contains the code (in C) and the data used to generate the catalogue, as well as a user manual (manual.ps). For compilation please IMPERATIVELY read the README file stored in the SPECFIND subdirectory. (1 data file).},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness from cosmic hydrogen at redshifts z>~6 have their source in the primordial density perturbations from inflation, as well as the radiation from galaxies. We propose a method to separate these components based on the angular dependence of the 21 cm fluctuation power spectrum. Peculiar velocities increase the power spectrum by a factor of ~2 compared with density fluctuations alone and introduce an angular dependence in Fourier space. The resulting angular structure relative to the line of sight facilitates a simple separation of the power spectrum into several components, permitting an unambiguous determination of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations, and of the detailed properties of all astrophysical sources of 21 cm fluctuations. We also demonstrate that angular multipoles are not useful for measuring large-scale power, and thus, theoretical predictions should focus on the three-dimensional power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations.},

The heading of fundamental physics includes conditions in the very early Universe and cosmological parameters that determine the age of the Universe and its matter content. The astrophysics refers to chapters of the long cosmic history of stars and galaxies that are being revealed through the effects of stellar feedback on the cosmic gas. This review describes the physics of the intergalactic medium, focusing on recent theoretical and observational developments in understanding early cosmic history. In particular, the earliest generation of stars is thought to have transformed the Universe from darkness to light and to have had an enormous impact on the intergalactic medium. Half a million years after the Big Bang the Universe was filled with atomic hydrogen. As gravity pulled gas clouds together, the first stars ignited and their radiation turned the surrounding atoms back into free electrons and ions. From the observed spectral absorption signatures of the gas between us and distant sources, we know that the process of reionization pervaded most of space a billion years after the Big Bang, so that only a small fraction of the primordial hydrogen atoms remained between galaxies. Knowing exactly when and how the reionization process happened is a primary goal of cosmologists, because this would tell us when the early stars and black holes formed and in what kinds of galaxies. The distribution and clustering of these galaxies is particularly interesting since it is driven by primordial density fluctuations in the dark matter. Cosmic reionization is beginning to be understood with the help of theoretical models and computer simulations. Numerical simulations of reionization are computationally challenging, as they require radiative transfer across large cosmological volumes as well as sufficiently high resolution to identify the sources of the ionizing radiation in the infant Universe. Rapid progress in our understanding is expected with additional observational input. A wide variety of instruments currently under design---including large-aperture infrared telescopes on the ground or in space (JWST), and low-frequency radio telescope arrays for the detection of redshifted 21 cm radiation---will probe the first sources of light during an epoch in cosmic history that has been largely unexplored so far. The new observations and the challenges for theoretical models and numerical simulations will motivate intense work in this field over the coming decade.},

We review clues to the nature and evolution of faint radio sources from deep optical identification and spectroscopy programs, as well as from HST imaging. The faint radio source population is a mixture of starburst, post-starburst and elliptical galaxies. The microwave radio emission at [mu]Jy-mJy levels is caused by a combination of (nuclear) starbursts and weak AGN activity. Each of these radio source populations evolved strongly with cosmic epoch, likely driven by the strongly epoch dependent galaxy merger rate, which has been winding down since z[less, approximate]0.5-1.0 when [Lambda] took over the expansion.},

title = {Cosmic Microwave Background Constraints on the Duration and Timing of Reionization from the South Pole Telescope},
abstract = {The epoch of reionization is a milestone of cosmological structure formation, marking the birth of the first objects massive enough to yield large numbers of ionizing photons. However, the mechanism and timescale of reionization remain largely unknown. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) Doppler effect from ionizing bubbles embedded in large-scale velocity streams---known as the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect---can be used to constrain the duration of reionization. When combined with large-scale CMB polarization measurements, the evolution of the ionized fraction, {\bar{x}}_e, can be inferred. Using new multi-frequency data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT), we show that the ionized fraction evolved relatively rapidly. For our basic foreground model, we find the kSZ power sourced by reionization at l = 3000 to be D patchy 3000 <= 2.1 μK2 at 95% confidence. Using reionization simulations, we translate this to a limit on the duration of reionization of \Delta z \equiv z_{{\bar{x}}_e=0.20}-z_{{\bar{x}}_e=0.99} \le 4.4 (95% confidence). We find that this constraint depends on assumptions about the angular correlation between the thermal SZ power and the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Introducing the degree of correlation as a free parameter, we find that the limit on kSZ power weakens to D patchy 3000 <= 4.9 μK2, implying Δz <= 7.9 (95% confidence). We combine the SPT constraint on the duration of reionization with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measurement of the integrated optical depth to probe the cosmic ionization history. We find that reionization ended with 95% confidence at z > 7.2 under the assumption of no tSZ-CIB correlation, and z > 5.8 when correlations are allowed. Improved constraints from the full SPT data set in conjunction with upcoming Herschel and Planck data should detect extended reionization at >95% confidence provided Δz >= 2. These CMB observations complement other observational probes of the epoch of reionization such as the redshifted 21 cm line and narrowband surveys for Lyα-emitting galaxies.},

title = {On the fractal structure of molecular clouds},
abstract = {We present a new method to analyze the structure of observed molecular cloud images which is the generalization of the Allan-variance method traditionally used in the stability and drift analysis of instrumentation and electronic devices. Applied to integrated intensity maps of two molecular cloud data sets, the method shows, together with an analysis of the phases of the cloud images, the observed structures to be well characterized by what is called a fractional Brownian motion (fBm)-structure in the context of fractal images. An fBm-structure results from a power law power spectrum of the image and a completely random distribution of the image phases. The power law index beta of the power spectrum derived for two sample clouds turns out to be close to 2.8. For an fBm-structure, the power spectral index beta determines other fractal measures such as the traditionally used box-counting dimension and the fractal dimension describing iso-intensity contours via their area-perimeter relation. We use a large data set covering observations at both large and small angular scales available for the Polaris Flare (Heithausen et al. \cite{heithausen1998}) as the sample cloud to test these concepts. The area-perimeter dimension independently measured for this cloud %, d=1.6, is consistent with beta =2.8. The fBm-concept allows easy generation of realistic density representations for model clouds, to be used in radiative transfer and other cloud simulations. In a second step, we show that an ensemble of randomly positioned clumps with a power law mass spectrum dN/dM ~ M(-alpha ) gives an fBm-image. The power spectral index beta , the mass spectral index alpha , and the power law index of the mass-size relation M ~ L(gamma ) turn out to be related: beta =gamma (3-alpha ). The value of gamma derived via this relation and the independently determined values for alpha and beta is consistent with the value directly determined for the sample cloud. Our analysis confirms the recent suggestion by Elmegreen {\&} Falgarone (\cite{elmegreen1996}) that the mass distribution in molecular clouds is closely connected with their fractal structure, although the detailed form of the relation depends on the fractal structure model used. We discuss the implications of these results, obtained for the 2-dimensional observed images, for the underlying 3-dimensional cloud density structure. With some extrapolating assumptions on the 3-dim structure, they imply that the 3-dimensional structure is very much broken up, with the surface growing proportional to the volume. Clearly, additional information on the velocity structure, and in particular its physical link to the assumed fBm-density structure, is needed to describe the relevant properties of molecular cloud line shapes and line radiative transfer. The fBm-structure model allows an estimate on the observability of molecular cloud structure down to much smaller angular scales than presently reachable, e.g. with interferometric observations. It turns out that, due to the steepness of the image power spectrum, these will be extremely difficult. Only the next generation large mm-wave array will bring such observations into the regime of the feasible.},

abstract = {A new generation of radio telescopes are currently being built with the goal of tracing the cosmic distribution of atomic hydrogen at redshifts 6-15 through its 21-cm line. The observations will probe the large-scale brightness fluctuations sourced by ionization fluctuations during cosmic reionization. Since detailed maps will be difficult to extract due to noise and foreground emission, efforts have focused on a statistical detection of the 21-cm fluctuations. During cosmic reionization, these fluctuations are highly non-Gaussian and thus more information can be extracted than just the one-dimensional function that is usually considered, i.e. the correlation function. We calculate a two-dimensional function that if measured observationally would allow a more thorough investigation of the properties of the underlying ionizing sources. This function is the probability distribution function (PDF) of the difference in the 21-cm brightness temperature between two points, as a function of the separation between the points. While the standard correlation function is determined by a complicated mixture of contributions from density and ionization fluctuations, we show that the difference PDF holds the key to separately measuring the statistical properties of the ionized regions.},

Due to the very low elevation of the observations, the survey has a much lower resolution in declination than in right ascension (54"x54"cosecδ). A correlation with the 1.4GHz NVSS (VIII/65) shows that the positional accuracy is less constrained in declination than in right ascension, but there is no significant systematic error. The correlation with the NVSS was also used to construct a sample of faint Ultra Steep Spectrum sources (file uss.dat, table 2 of the paper).

title = {Hierarchical galaxy formation},
abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the ΛCDM cosmology f12(M1,M2) dM1 [1/√2π] [(δc1 - δc2)/ (σ21 - σ22)3/2] x exp [-(δc1 - δc2)2/ 2(σ22)] [dσ21/dM1] d M1 (Ω0=0.3) (df12)/(dt1 t1t2) dM1 dt1 [1/√(2π)] [1 / σ21 - σ22)3/2] [dδc1/dt1] [dσ21/dM1] dM1 dt1 Λ0=0.7),-> and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since [dN/dM1] [df12/dt1] [M2/M1] dt1 (M1 < M2). z <~1.5.},

title = {A Per-baseline, Delay-spectrum Technique for Accessing the 21 cm Cosmic Reionization Signature},
abstract = {A critical challenge in measuring the power spectrum of 21 cm emission from cosmic reionization is compensating for the frequency dependence of an interferometer's sampling pattern, which can cause smooth-spectrum foregrounds to appear unsmooth and degrade the separation between foregrounds and the target signal. In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that explicitly accounts for this frequency dependence. We apply the delay transformation introduced in Parsons {\&} Backer to each baseline of an interferometer to concentrate smooth-spectrum foregrounds within the bounds of the maximum geometric delays physically realizable on that baseline. By focusing on delay modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the horizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum foregrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay modes to k-space, showing that delay modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent samples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain cosmic reionization. Because it uses only spectral smoothness to differentiate foregrounds from the targeted 21 cm signature, this per-baseline analysis approach relies on spectrally and spatially smooth instrumental responses for foreground removal. For sufficient levels of instrumental smoothness relative to the brightness of interfering foregrounds, this technique substantially reduces the level of calibration previously thought necessary to detect 21 cm reionization. As a result, this approach places fewer constraints on antenna configuration within an array, and in particular, facilitates the adoption of configurations that are optimized for power-spectrum sensitivity. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the potential for the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) to detect 21 cm reionization at an amplitude of 10 mK2 near k ~ 0.2 h Mpc--1 with 132 dipoles in 7 months of observing.},

title = {Calibration of Low-Frequency, Wide-Field Radio Interferometers Using Delay/Delay-Rate Filtering},
abstract = {We present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines of wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select regions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The technique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra from a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional "delay images," and then the transformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional "delay/delay-rate images." Source selection is possible in these images given appropriate combinations of baseline, bandwidth, integration time, and source location. Strong and persistent radio frequency interference (RFI) limits the effectiveness of this source selection owing to the removal of data by RFI excision algorithms. A one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been developed to compensate for RFI-excision effects. This approach allows CLEANed, source-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain functions. These techniques are applied to data from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization as a demonstration of their value in calibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide relative bandwidths and large fields of view.},

title = {A candidate redshift z~10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population at an age of 500Myr},
abstract = {Searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded a large sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000million years (Myr) after the Big Bang (redshifts 6>z>3 ref. 1). The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z~8 galaxies that, together with reports of a γ-ray burst at z~8.2 (refs 10, 11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. Observations of z~7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z>9-10 (refs 12, 13). Here we use the full two-year HUDF09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z~10 galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500Myr after the Big Bang. Not only do we find one possible z~10 galaxy candidate, but we show that, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is much smaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200Myr later at z~8. This demonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z~10, as galaxies increased in both luminosity density and volume density from z~10 to z~8. The 100-200Myr before z~10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliest galaxies.},

title = {MITEoR: A Scalable Interferometer for Precision 21 cm Cosmology},
abstract = {Tomographically mapping our universe using the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen can revolutionize our picture of the early universe, providing a unique probe of the "cosmic dawn" and the Epoch of Reionization. By mapping a vast comoving volume, it can potentially overtake the cosmic microwave background as our most powerful cosmological probe. We report on MIT Epoch of Reionization (MITEoR), a pathfinder low-frequency radio interferometer whose goal is to test technologies that improve the calibration precision and reduce the cost of such high-sensitivity 3D mapping. MITEoR accomplishes this by using massive baseline redundancy, which enables both automated precision calibration and correlator cost reduction. For an {\$}N{\$} antenna instrument, the cost scaling is reduced from {\$}N^2{\$} to {\$}N\log N{\$}. We demonstrate and quantify the power and robustness of redundancy for scalability and precision. We find that our calibration parameters precisely describe the effect of the instrument upon our measurements, allowing us to form a model that is consistent with {\$}\chi^2{\$} per degree of freedom {\$}< 1.2{\$} for as much as {\$}80\%{\$} of our observations. We use our results to develop an optimal estimator of calibration parameters using Wiener filtering, and explore the question of how often and how finely in frequency visibilites must be reliably measured to solve for calibration coefficients. The success of MITEoR with its 64 dual-polarization elements bodes well for the more ambitious Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) project and other next-generation instruments, which would incorporate many identical or similar technologies using hundreds more antennas, each with dramatically larger collecting area.},

MAXIMA is a balloon-borne experiment with an array of 16 bolometric photometers operated at 100 mK. MAXIMA observed a 124 square degrees region of the sky with 10 arcminute resolution at frequencies of 150, 240 and 410 GHz. The data were calibrated using in-flight measurements of the CMB dipole anisotropy. A map of the CMB anisotropy was produced from three 150 and one 240 GHz photometer without need for foreground subtractions. Analysis of this CMB map yields a power spectrum for the CMB anisotropy over the range 36 < l < 785. The spectrum shows a peak with an amplitude of 78 +/- 6 micro-Kelvin at l ~ 220 and an amplitude varying between ~40 micro-Kelvin and ~50 micro-Kelvin for 400 < l < 785. },

The computational demands of these imaging systems scale in proportion to , where is the signal bandwidth, is the number of independent beams, and is the number of antennas. The specifications of many new arrays lead to demands in excess of tens of PetaOps per second. To meet this challenge, we have developed a general-purpose correlator architecture using standard 10-Gbit Ethernet switches to pass data between flexible hardware modules containing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. These chips are programmed using open-source signal-processing libraries that we have developed to be flexible, scalable, and chip-independent. This work reduces the time and cost of implementing a wide range of signal-processing systems, with correlators foremost among them, and facilitates upgrading to new generations of processing technology. We present several correlator deployments, including a 16-antenna, 200-MHz bandwidth, 4-bit, full-Stokes parameter application deployed on the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization.},

title = {Characteristic scales during reionization},
abstract = {One of the key observables of the reionization era is the distribution of neutral and ionized gas. Recently, Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist developed a simple analytic model to describe the growth of HII regions during this era. Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions behind this model and generalize it in several important ways. The model predicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size Rc that ranges from ~1Mpc in the early phases to >~10Mpc in the late phases. We show that Rc is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies driving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental property of the first galaxies. The variance around Rc, on the other hand, is determined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that increasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts Rc to significantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations. These differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21-cm surveys (increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of 2 on large scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Finally, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the galaxy population only broaden the bubble size distribution significantly if massive galaxies are responsible for most of the ionizing photons. We argue that the key results of this model are robust to many of our uncertainties about the reionization process.},

We have therefore observed the dust continuum emission from a sample of z>3 radio galaxies with the SCUBA bolometer array. We confirm and strengthen the result found by Archibald et al.

We also observed HzRG candidates that have so far eluded spectroscopic redshift determination.

Recent observations at near-IR and radio wavelengths imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z ⩾ 6. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will provide critical insight into the EoR, in a number of ways. First, the ability of the SKA to image the neutral IGM in 21-cm emission is a truly unique probe of the process of reionization, and is recognized as the next necessary and fundamental step in our study of the evolution of large scale structure and cosmic reionization. Second, study of HI 21-cm absorption toward the first radio loud objects probes small to intermediate scale structure in the neutral `cosmic web', as well as HI in the first collapsed structures (proto-disks and mini-halos). And third, the incomparable sensitivity of the SKA allows for the study of the molecular gas, dust, and star formation activity in the first galaxies, as well as the radio continuum emission from the first accreting massive black holes. Such objects will be obscured at optical wavelengths due to absorption by the neutral IGM.},

abstract = {Powerful radio galaxies often display enhanced optical/UV continuum emission and extended emission line regions, elongated and aligned with the radio jet axis. The expansion of the radio source strongly affects the gas clouds in the surrounding IGM, and the kinematic and ionization properties of the extended emission line regions display considerable variation over the lifetime of individual sources, as well as with cosmic epoch. We present the results of deep rest-frame UV and optical imaging and UV spectroscopy of high redshift 6C radio galaxies. The interdependence of the host galaxy and radio source properties are discussed, considering: (i) the relative contribution of shocks associated with the expanding radio source to the observed emission line gas kinematics, and their effect on the ionization state of the gas; (ii) the similarities and differences between the morphologies of the host galaxies and aligned emission for a range of radio source powers; and (iii) the influence of radio power on the strength of the observed alignment effect.},

title = {Probing Reionization with the 21 cm Galaxy Cross-Power Spectrum},
abstract = {The cross-correlation between high-redshift galaxies and 21 cm emission from the high-redshift intergalactic medium promises to be an excellent probe of the Epoch of Reionization. On large scales, the 21 cm and galaxy fields are anticorrelated during most of the reionization epoch. However, on scales smaller than the size of the H II regions around detectable galaxies, the two fields become roughly uncorrelated. Consequently, the 21 cm galaxy cross-power spectrum provides a tracer of bubble growth during reionization, with the signal turning over on progressively larger scales as reionization proceeds. The precise turnover scale depends on the minimum host mass of the detectable galaxies, and the galaxy selection technique. Measuring the turnover scale as a function of galaxy luminosity constrains the characteristic bubble size around galaxies of different luminosities. The cross-spectrum becomes positive on small scales if ionizing photons fail to escape from low-mass galaxies, and these galaxies are detectable longward of the hydrogen ionization edge, because in this case some identifiable galaxies lie outside the ionized regions. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and Low Frequency Array can potentially measure the 21 cm galaxy cross-spectrum in conjunction with mild extensions to the existing Subaru survey for z = 6.6 Lyα emitters. A futuristic galaxy survey covering a sizable fraction of the MWA field of view (~800 deg2) can probe the scale dependence of the cross-spectrum, constraining the filling factor of H II regions at different redshifts during reionization, and providing other valuable constraints on reionization models.},

We present a census of black holes as function of redshift and will determine their mass assembly history under a variety of assumptions regarding the importance of gas accretion in black hole growth, from early supercritical Eddington accretion to gas-poor hierarchical assembly. Following a galaxy merger, black holes are expected to form, inspiral and merge after strongly radiating energy via gravitational waves. For each binary black hole inspiral and merger, we determine the expected gravitational wave signal for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and calculate the LISA event rate as a function of time. We will calculate the black hole mass assembly history for several black hole growth scenerios, so that we can explore tests to characterize each model observationally. In particular, we will study how well LISA observations will be able to distinguish between these very different assembly scenarios.},

title = {Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopic Evidence for a 2 10 9 Msun Black Hole in NGC 3115},
abstract = {The discovery by Kormendy {\&} Richstone of an M* ~= 109 M{\.o} massive dark object (MDO) in NGC 3115 is confirmed with higher resolution spectroscopy from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Measurements with the CFHT and Subarcsecond Imaging Spectrograph improve the resolution from sigma * = 0."44 to sigma * = 0."244 ( sigma * = Gaussian dispersion radius of the point-spread function). The apparent central velocity dispersion rises from sigma = 295 +/- 9 km s-1 to sigma = 343 +/- 19 km s-1. The Faint Object Spectrograph and COSTAR-corrected HST provide a further improvement in resolution using a 0."21 aperture. Then, the measured sigma = 443 +/- 18 km s-1 is remarkably high, and the wings of the velocity profiles extend beyond 1200 km s-1 from the line centers. Similarly, the apparent rotation curve rises much more rapidly than is observed from the ground. Published dynamical models fit the new observations reasonably well when "observed" at the improved spatial resolution; V and sigma are at the high end of the predicted range near the center. Therefore, M* > 109 M{\.o}. The spatial resolution has now improved by a factor of ~5 since the discovery observations, and the case for a central MDO has strengthened correspondingly. With HST and the Second Wide Field and Planetary Camera, NGC 3115 also shows a bright nucleus. This is very prominent and distinct from the bulge when the superposed nuclear disk is subtracted. After bulge subtraction, the nucleus has sigma = 600 +/- 37 km s-1, the largest central dispersion seen in any galaxy. If the nucleus contained only old stars and not an MDO, its escape velocity would be ~352 km s-1, much smaller than the observed velocities of the stars. This is independent proof that an MDO is present. The new observations put more stringent constraints on the radius inside which the dark mass lies and strengthen the case that it is a 2 x 109 M{\.o} black hole.},

abstract = {We have used archival 74 MHz Very Large Array data spanning the last 15 years in combination with new data from the Long-Wavelength Demonstrator Array and data from the literature covering the last 50 years to explore the evolution of Cas A at low radio frequencies. We find that the secular decrease of the flux density of Cas A at ~80 MHz is rather stable over five decades of time, decreasing at a rate of 0.7%-0.8% yr-1. This is entirely consistent with previous estimates at frequencies as low as 38 MHz, indicating that the secular decrease is roughly the same at low frequencies, at least between 38 and 80 MHz. We also find strong evidence for as many as four modes of flux density oscillation about the slower secular decrease with periods of 3.10 $\pm$ 0.02 yr, 5.1 $\pm$ 0.3 yr, 9.0 $\pm$ 0.2 yr, and 24 $\pm$ 2 yr. These are also consistent with fluctuations seen previously to occur on scales of a few years. These results provide compelling motivation for a thorough low-frequency monitoring campaign of Cas A to constrain the nature and physical origins of these fluctuations, and to be able to better predict the flux density of Cas A at any given epoch so that it may be used as a reliable low-frequency calibrator.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges for future 21 cm observations is to remove foregrounds which are several orders of magnitude more intense than the H I signal. We propose a new technique for removing foregrounds of the redshifted 21 cm observations. We consider multi-frequency interferometer observations. We assume that the 21 cm signals in different frequency channels are uncorrelated and the foreground signals change slowly as a function of frequency. When we add the visibilities of all channels, the foreground signals increase roughly by a factor of ~N because they are highly correlated. However, the 21 cm signals increase by a factor of {\sim} \sqrt{N} because the signals in different channels contribute randomly. This enables us to obtain an accurate shape of the foreground angular power spectrum. Then, we obtain the 21 cm power spectrum by subtracting the foreground power spectrum obtained this way. We describe how to obtain the average power spectrum of the 21 cm signal.},

title = {The Molonglo Southern 4 Jy Sample (MS4). I. Definition},
abstract = {ABSTRACT 
We have defined a complete sample of 228 southern radio sources at 408 MHz with integrated flux densities 
S408 > 4:0 Jy, Galactic latitude 
jbj > 10􏰀 , and declination 􏰂85􏰀 < 􏰀 < 􏰂30􏰀 . The main finding survey used was 
the Molonglo Reference Catalogue. We describe in detail how the Molonglo Southern 4 Jy sample ( MS4) was 
assembled and its completeness assessed. Sources in the sample were imaged at 843 MHz with the Molonglo 
Observatory Synthesis Telescope to obtain positions accurate to about 100 , as well as flux densities and angular sizes; 
follow-up radio and optical observations are presented in Paper II. Radio spectra for the MS4 have been compiled 
from the literature and used to estimate flux densities at 178 MHz. The strong-source subset of MS4, with S178 > 
10:9 Jy (SMS4), provides a southern sample closely equivalent to the well-studied northern 3CRR sample. Com- 
parison of SMS4 with 3CRR shows a reassuring similarity in source density and median flux density between the 
two samples.

title = {Optimal Image Reconstruction in Radio Interferometry},
abstract = { We introduce a method for analyzing radio interferometry data which produces maps which are optimal in the Bayesian sense of maximum posterior probability density, given certain prior assumptions. It is similar to maximum entropy techniques, but with an exact accounting of the multiplicity instead of the usual approximation involving Stirling's formula. It also incorporates an Occam factor, automatically limiting the effective amount of detail in the map to that justified by the data. We use Gibbs sampling to determine, to any desired degree of accuracy, the multi-dimensional posterior density distribution. From this we can construct a mean posterior map and other measures of the posterior density, including confidence limits on any well-defined function of the posterior map. },

title = {Expanded Very Large Array Observations of Galactic Supernova Remnants: Wide-field Continuum and Spectral-index Imaging},
abstract = {The radio continuum emission from the Galaxy has a rich mix of thermal and non-thermal emission. This very richness makes its interpretation challenging since the low radio opacity means that a radio image represents the sum of all emission regions along the line of sight. These challenges make the existing narrowband radio surveys of the Galactic plane difficult to interpret: e.g., a small region of emission might be a supernova remnant (SNR) or an H II region, or a complex combination of both. Instantaneous wide bandwidth radio observations in combination with the capability for high-resolution spectral-index mapping can be directly used to disentangle these effects. Here we demonstrate simultaneous continuum and spectral-index imaging capability at the full continuum sensitivity and resolution using newly developed wide-band wide-field imaging algorithms. Observations were conducted in the L and C bands with a total bandwidth of 1 and 2 GHz, respectively. We present preliminary results in the form of a full-field continuum image covering the wide-band sensitivity pattern of the EVLA centered on a large but poorly studied SNR (G55.7 + 3.4) and relatively narrower field continuum and spectral-index maps of three fields containing SNR and diffused thermal emission. We demonstrate that spatially resolved spectral-index maps differentiate regions with emission of different physical origins (spectral-index variation across composite SNRs and separation of thermal and non-thermal emission), superimposed along the line of sight. The wide-field image centered on the SNR G55.7+3.4 also demonstrates the excellent wide-field wide-band imaging capability of the EVLA.},

Being the nearest gas-rich neighbours of the Milky Way the MCs give us an excellent opportunity to study in detail the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the effect of interactions between galaxies. HI in emission provides an excellent probe of the structure and velocity field of the Clouds, allowing the study of their velocity dispersion, 3-D structure, and large-scale total-mass distribution. Recent data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array surveys reveal a morphology (for both Clouds) which is heavily dominated by the effects of local star-formation, rotational shear, fragmentation, self-gravity and turbulence. The new data, which has a spatial resolution down to 10 pc, also allows the study of the distribution functions in velocity and mass for HI clouds. A comparison between both Clouds is made, and implications for the future evolution of the Magellanic Clouds are discussed.},

title = {A new layout optimization technique for interferometric arrays, applied to the Murchison Widefield Array},
abstract = {Antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometers because it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (PSF, or array beam). This is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21-cm Epoch of Reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtraction depends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of the baseline distribution. Nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas can be placed - even at the remote Australian location of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas, emergency runways and trees. These exclusion areas can introduce spatial structure into the baseline distribution that enhances the PSF sidelobes and reduces the angular dynamic range. In this paper we present a new method of constrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in the baseline distribution. This method not only outperforms random placement algorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms random placement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are the smoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. We use our new algorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned MWA, and present the antenna locations, baseline distribution and snapshot PSF for this array choice.},

We are able, for the first time, to explain the wedge-like structure seen in advanced simulations and to forecast the shape of an "EoR window" that is mostly free of contamination. Understanding the origins of these contaminations also enables us to identify calibration and foreground subtraction errors below the imaging limit, providing a powerful new tool for precision observations.},

Although very little is known about inner galaxy triggering mechanisms, there appear to be examples that parallel the well-known mechanisms around us. The balance may shift slightly, however, because of the high densities in nuclear regions. The sequential triggering mode, in which one generation of stars triggers another, should be less prominent compared to gravitational instabilities and turbulence triggering when the ambient density is so high that the local dynamical timescale is less than the lifetime of an O-type star. Regardless of this shift in balance, the star formation rate seems to follow the same column density scaling law as in main disks, probably because it is everywhere saturated to the maximum possible value allowed by the fractal structure of the interstellar medium.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT While limited to low spatial resolution, the next-generation low-frequency radio interferometers that target 21-cm observations during the era of reionization and prior will have instantaneous fields of view that are many tens of deg2 on the sky. Predictions related to various statistical measurements of the 21-cm brightness temperature must then be pursued with numerical simulations of reionization with correspondingly large volume box sizes, of the order of 1000 Mpc on one side. We pursue a semi-numerical scheme to simulate the 21-cm signal during and prior to reionization by extending a hybrid approach where simulations are performed by first laying down the linear dark matter density field, accounting for the non-linear evolution of the density field based on second-order linear perturbation theory as specified by the Zel'dovich approximation, and then specifying the location and mass of collapsed dark matter haloes using the excursion-set formalism. The location of ionizing sources and the time evolving distribution of ionization field is also specified using an excursion-set algorithm. We account for the brightness temperature evolution through the coupling between spin and gas temperature due to collisions, radiative coupling in the presence of Lyman α photons and heating of the intergalactic medium, such as due to a background of X-ray photons. The hybrid simulation method we present is capable of producing the required large volume simulations with adequate resolution in a reasonable time, so a large number of realizations can be obtained with variations in assumptions related to astrophysics and background cosmology that govern the 21-cm signal.},

title = {Reconstruction of piecewise homogeneous images from partial knowledge of their Fourier Transform},
abstract = {Fourier synthesis (FS) inverse problem consists in reconstructing a multi-variable function from the measured data which correspond to partial and uncertain knowledge of its Fourier Transform (FT). By partial knowledge we mean either partial support and/or the knowledge of only the module and by uncertain we mean both uncertainty of the model and noisy data. This inverse problem arises in many applications such as : optical imaging, radio astronomy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffraction scattering (ultrasounds or microwave imaging). Most classical methods of inversion are based on interpolation of the data and fast inverse FT. But when the data do not fill uniformly the Fourier domain or when the phase of the signal is lacking as in optical interferometry, the results obtained by such methods are not satisfactory, because these inverse problems are ill-posed. The Bayesian estimation approach, via an appropriate modeling of the unknown functions gives the possibility of compensating the lack of information in the data, thus giving satisfactory results. In this paper we study the case where the observations are a part of the FT modulus of objects which are composed of a few number of homogeneous materials. To model such objects we use a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) and propose a Bayesian inversion method using appropriate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.},

title = {A Rotation Measure Image of the Sky},
abstract = {We have re-analyzed the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data to derive rotation measures (RMs) toward 37,543 polarized radio sources. The resulting catalog of RM values covers the sky area north of declination -40$\,^{\circ}$ with an average density of more than one RM per square degree. We present an image of the median RM over 82% of the sky with a resolution of 8$\,^{\circ}$ and a typical error of $\pm$1-2 rad m-2. The image shows large-scale structures in RM that extend to very high Galactic latitudes. A simple analysis of the RM structure at high Galactic latitudes is used to derive properties of the Galactic halo magnetic field in the solar neighborhood. We find the component of the local field perpendicular to the plane (the z-component) equal to +0.30 μG for z < 0 and -0.14 μG for z>0. The reversal of sign across the Galactic plane is consistent with a quadrupole field geometry for the poloidal component of the halo field. The halo magnetic field component parallel to the disk is also found to be antisymmetric and generally consistent with a toroidal field, with strength +0.83 μG for z < 0 and -0.39 μG for z>0. We have identified five regions of the sky where the foreground median RM is consistently less than 1 rad m-2 over several degrees. These holes in the foreground RM will be useful for future studies of possible small-scale fluctuations in cosmic magnetic field structures. In addition to allowing measurement of RMs toward polarized sources, the new analysis of the NVSS data removes the effects of bandwidth depolarization for |RM| gsim 100 rad m-2 inherent in the original NVSS source catalog. This new catalog of RMs and polarized flux densities is available online, and will be a valuable resource for further studies of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetoionic medium, and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

title = {A Sensitivity and Array-configuration Study for Measuring the Power Spectrum of 21 cm Emission from Reionization},
abstract = {Telescopes aiming to measure 21 cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization must toe a careful line, balancing the need for raw sensitivity against the stringent calibration requirements for removing bright foregrounds. It is unclear what the optimal design is for achieving both of these goals. Via a pedagogical derivation of an interferometer's response to the power spectrum of 21 cm reionization fluctuations, we show that even under optimistic scenarios first-generation arrays will yield low-signal-to-noise detections, and that different compact array configurations can substantially alter sensitivity. We explore the sensitivity gains of array configurations that yield high redundancy in the uv-plane---configurations that have been largely ignored since the advent of self-calibration for high-dynamic-range imaging. We first introduce a mathematical framework to generate optimal minimum-redundancy configurations for imaging. We contrast the sensitivity of such configurations with high-redundancy configurations, finding that high-redundancy configurations can improve power-spectrum sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude. We explore how high-redundancy array configurations can be tuned to various angular scales, enabling array sensitivity to be directed away from regions of the uv-plane (such as the origin) where foregrounds are brighter and instrumental systematics are more problematic. We demonstrate that a 132 antenna deployment of the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization observing for 120 days in a high-redundancy configuration will, under ideal conditions, have the requisite sensitivity to detect the power spectrum of the 21 cm signal from reionization at a 3σ level at k < 0.25 h Mpc-1 in a bin of Δln k = 1. We discuss the tradeoffs of low- versus high-redundancy configurations.},

It has measured the CMB power spectrum with a ten-arcminute FWHM beam, corresponding to a detection of the power spectrum out to spherical harmonic multipole l~1000. The spectrum is consistent with a flat Universe with a nearly scale-invariant initial spectrum of adiabatic density fluctuations. Moreover, the MAXIMA data are free from any notable non-Gaussian contamination and from foreground dust emission. In the same region, the WMAP experiment observes the same structure as that observed by MAXIMA, as evinced by analysis of both maps and power spectra. The next step in the evolution of the MAXIMA program is MAXIPOL, which will observe the polarization of the CMB with comparable resolution and high sensitivity over a small patch of the sky. },

title = {Detection of Signals from Cosmic Reionization Using Radio Interferometric Signal Processing},
abstract = {Observations of the H I 21 cm transition line promises to be an important probe into the cosmic dark ages and epoch of reionization. One of the challenges for the detection of this signal is the accuracy of the foreground source removal. This paper investigates the extragalactic point source contamination and how accurately the bright sources (gsim1 Jy) should be removed in order to reach the desired rms noise and be able to detect the 21 cm transition line. Here, we consider position and flux errors in the global sky model for these bright sources as well as the frequency independent residual calibration errors. The synthesized beam is the only frequency dependent term included here. This work determines the level of accuracy for the calibration and source removal schemes and puts forward constraints for the design of the cosmic reionization data reduction scheme for the upcoming low frequency arrays such as, Murchison Widefield Array, Precision Array to Probe Epoch of Reionization, etc. We show that in order to detect the reionization signal the bright sources need to be removed from the data sets with a positional accuracy of ~0.1 arcsec. Our results also demonstrate that the efficient foreground source removal strategies can only tolerate a frequency independent antenna based mean residual calibration error of lsim0.2% in amplitude or lsim0fdg2 in phase, if they are constant over each days of observations (6 hr). In future papers, we will extend this analysis to the power-spectral domain and also include the frequency-dependent calibration errors and direction-dependent errors (ionosphere, primary beam, etc.).},

title = {The 21-cm emission from the reionization epoch: extended and point source foregrounds},
abstract = {Fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen probe the epoch of reionization. We examine the observability of this signal and the impact of extragalactic foreground radio sources (both extended and point-like). We use cosmological simulations to predict the angular correlation functions of intensity fluctuations due to unresolved radio galaxies, cluster radio haloes and relics and free-free emission from the interstellar and intergalactic medium at the frequencies and angular scales relevant for the proposed 21-cm tomography. In accord with previous findings, the brightness temperature fluctuations due to foreground sources are much larger than those from the primary 21-cm signal at all scales. In particular, diffuse cluster radio emission, which has been previously neglected, provides the most significant foreground contamination. However, we show that the contribution to the angular fluctuations at scales θ>~ 1 arcmin is dominated by the spatial clustering of bright foreground sources. This excess can be removed if sources above flux levels S>~ 0.1 mJy (out to redshifts of z~ 1 and z~ 2 for diffuse and point sources, respectively) are detected and removed. Hence, efficient source removal may be sufficient to allow the detection of angular fluctuations in the 21-cm emission free of extragalactic foregrounds at θ>~ 1 arcmin. In addition, the removal of sources above S= 0.1 mJy also reduces the foreground fluctuations to roughly the same level as the 21-cm signal at scales θ<~ 1 arcmin. This should allow the substraction of the foreground components in frequency space, making it possible to observe in detail the topology and history of reionization.},

title = {A closer look at using quasar near-zones as a probe of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium},
abstract = {We examine a large set of synthetic quasar spectra to realistically assess the potential of using the relative sizes of highly ionized near-zones in the Lyα and Lyβ forest as a probe of the neutral hydrogen content of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z > 6. The scatter in the relative near-zone size distribution, induced by underlying fluctuations in the baryonic density field and the filtering of ionizing radiation, is considerable even for fixed assumptions about the IGM neutral fraction. As a consequence, the current observational data cannot distinguish between an IGM which is significantly neutral or one which is highly ionized just above z = 6. Under standard assumptions for quasar ages and ionizing luminosities, a future sample of several tens of high-resolution Lyα and Lyβ near-zone spectra should be capable of distinguishing between a volume-weighted neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM which is greater or less than 10 per cent.},

title = {Foreground Contamination in Interferometric Measurements of the Redshifted 21 cm Power Spectrum},
abstract = {Subtraction of astrophysical foreground contamination from "dirty" sky maps produced by simulated measurements of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has been performed by fitting a 3rd-order polynomial along the spectral dimension of each pixel in the data cubes. The simulations are the first to include the unavoidable instrumental effects of the frequency-dependent primary antenna beams and synthesized array beams. They recover the one-dimensional spherically-binned input redshifted 21 cm power spectrum to within approximately 1% over the scales probed most sensitively by the MWA (0.01 < k < 1 Mpc^-1) and demonstrate that realistic instrumental effects will not mask the EoR signal. We find that the weighting function used to produce the dirty sky maps from the gridded visibility measurements is important to the success of the technique. Uniform weighting of the visibility measurements produces the best results, whereas natural weighting significantly worsens the foreground subtraction by coupling structure in the density of the visibility measurements to spectral structure in the dirty sky map data cube. The extremely dense uv-coverage of the MWA was found to be advantageous for this technique and produced very good results on scales corresponding to |u| < 500 wavelengths in the uv-plane without any selective editing of the uv-coverage.},

title = {A Temperature-Based Gain Calibration Technique for Precision Radiometry},
abstract = {Detecting extremely weak signals in radio astronomy demands high sensitivity and stability of the receivers. The gain of a typical radio astronomy receiver is extremely large, and therefore, even very small gain instabilities can dominate the received noise power and degrade the instrument sensitivity. Hence, receiver stabilization is of prime importance. Gain variations occur mainly due to ambient temperature fluctuations. We take a new approach to receiver stabilization, which makes use of active temperature monitoring and corrects for the gain fluctuations in post processing. This approach is purely passive and does not include noise injection or switching for calibration. This system is to be used for the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), which is being developed to detect the extremely faint neutral hydrogen (HI) signature of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The epoch of reionization refers to the period in the history of the Universe when the first stars and galaxies started to form. When there are N antenna elements in the case of a large scale array, all elements may not be subjected to the same environmental conditions at a given time. Hence, we expect to mitigate the gain variations by monitoring the physical temperature of each element of the array. This stabilization approach will also benefit experiments like EDGES (Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature) and DARE (Dark Ages Radio Explorer), which involve a direct measurement of the global 21 cm signal using a single antenna element and hence, require an extremely stable system. This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of a calibration technique that compensates for the gain variations caused due to temperature fluctuations of the RF components. It carefully examines the temperature dependence of the components in the receiver chain. The results from the first-order field instrument, called a Gainometer (GoM), highlight the issue with the cable temperature which varies significantly with different climatic conditions. The model used to correct for gain variations is presented. We describe the measurements performed to verify the model. RFI is a major issue at low frequencies, which makes these kind of measurements extremely challenging. We discuss the careful measures required to mitigate the errors due to the unwanted interference. In the case of the laboratory measurements, the model follows closely with the measured power, and shows an improvement in the gain stability by a factor of ˜ 46, when the corrections are applied. The gain stability (rms to mean) improves from 1 part in 32 to 1 part in 1500. The field measurements suggest that correcting for cable temperature variations is challenging. The improvement in the gain stability is by a factor of ˜ 4.3, when the RF front end components are situated out in the field. The results are analyzed using the statistical methods such as the standard error of the mean, the run test, skewness, and kurtosis. These tests demonstrate the normal distribution of the process when the corrections are applied and confirm an effective gain bias removal. The results obtained from the sky observation using a single antenna element are compared before and after applying the corrections. Several days data verify that the power fluctuations are significantly reduced after the gain corrections are applied.},

abstract = {We present observations taken with the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) of the Centaurus A field in the frequency range 114-188 MHz. The resulting image has a 25 arcmin resolution, a dynamic range of 3500 and an rms of 0.5 Jy beam-1 (for a beam size of 25 arcmin × 23 arcmin). A spectral index map of Cen A is produced across the full band. The spectral index distribution is qualitatively consistent with electron reacceleration in regions of excess turbulence in the radio lobes, as previously identified morphologically. Hence, there appears to be an association of `severe weather' in radio lobes with energy input into the relativistic electron population. We compare the PAPER large-scale radio image with the X-ray image from the ROSAT All Sky Survey. There is a tentative correlation between radio and X-ray features at the end of the southern lobe, some 200 kpc from the nucleus, as might be expected from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the cosmic microwave background by the relativistic electrons also responsible for the radio synchrotron emission. The magnetic fields derived from the (possible) IC and radio emission are of similar magnitude to fields derived under the minimum pressure assumptions, ˜ 1 μG. However, the X-ray field is complex, with large-scale gradients and features possibly unrelated to Cen A. If these X-ray features are unrelated to Cen A, then these fields are lower limits.},

title = {Foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line. I. First Westerbork measurements of Galactic emission at 150 MHz in a low latitude field},
abstract = {Context: The cosmological 21 cm line promises to be a formidable tool for cosmology, allowing the investigation of the end of the so-called dark ages, when the first galaxies formed. Aims: Astrophysical foregrounds are expected to be about three orders of magnitude greater than the cosmological signal and therefore represent a serious contamination of the cosmological 21 cm line. Detailed knowledge of both their intensity and polarization structure on the relevant angular scale of 1-30 arcmin will be essential for extracting the cosmological signal from the data. Methods: We present the first results from a series of observations conducted with the Westerbork telescope in the 140-160 MHz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimed at characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionization experiments. The polarization data were analysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. We computed total intensity and polarization angular power spectra. Results: For the first time we have detected fluctuations in the Galactic diffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 MHz, in the low Galactic latitude area known as Fan region, centred at α = 3^h10^m, δ = 65$\,^{\circ}$ 30'. Those fluctuations have an rms of 14 K. The total intensity power spectrum shows a power-law behaviour down to ℓ 900 with slope β^I_ℓ = -2.2 $\pm$ 0.3. The detection of diffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual point sources. We measured an rms confusion noise of 3 mJy beam-1. Diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at this frequency. The polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially and along the line of sight. The polarization power spectrum is not affected by residual point sources and is only limited by the thermal noise. It shows a power-law behaviour down to ℓ 2700 with slope β^P_ℓ = -1.65 $\pm$ 0.15. The rms of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 K on 4 arcmin scales. Conclusions: The measured total intensity fluctuations are used to estimate the foreground contamination on the cosmological signal. By extrapolating the spectrum of total intensity emission, we find a contamination of δ T= √{ℓ (ℓ+1) C^I_ℓ / 2π} ˜ 5.7 K on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding rms value of 18.3 K at the same angular scale. The level of the polarization power spectrum is δ T 3.3 K on 5 arcmin scales. However, the Fan region cannot be taken as representative of other sky regions, given its exceptionally bright polarized signal, but is likely to represent an upper limit on the sky brightness at moderate and high Galactic latitude.},
