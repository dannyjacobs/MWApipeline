MWA power spectra computed using two foreground subtraction methods and two power spectrum estimation methods.  In the top row data have been calibrated to a catalog followed by subtraction of a deeper catalog modelled into instrumental space using the Fast Holographic Deconvolution method, in the bottom row calibration and foreground subtraction have been performed with the MWA Real Time System.  In the left column, power spectra have been estimated with data that have had baselines averaged into a $uvf$ grid while in the right baselines are cross multiplied individually to make a optimally weighted estimate of the power spectrum.
