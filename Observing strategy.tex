The MWA has observed 350 hours during the Fall 2013 EoR season.  The two main observing variables are choice of 30MHz band and pointing. Total time is limited. Observations are thermal noise limited. After about 1000 hours on a particular sky location and tuning they become cosmic variance limited.   Because 1000 hours per pointing is thought to be an achievable goal,
