\section{Introduction} 
The direct detection of 21 cm emission from inter-galactic HI leading up to the end of Epoch of Reionization is currently the goal of several projects around the world. 

Science case for EoR.

Overview of pipeline components and how they fit together.

In section XXX we describe our observations strategy, in section XXX calibration, imaging and foreground removal, in section XXX power spectrum estimation, and conclude in XXX.
