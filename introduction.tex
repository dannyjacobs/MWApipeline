\section{Introduction} 
  Study of intergalactic Hydrogen  in the early universe via the 21\,cm line is forecast to provide a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information.  The 21\,cm line is both optically thin and spectrally narrow, making possible full tomographic reconstruction. Cosmological Hydrogen, which makes up 3/4 of baryonic matter, is neutral over cosmic time from recombination until reionized by the first batch of UV emitters (stars and accretion disks).  Reviews of 21 cm cosmology and observing can be found in \cite{Morales:2010p8093,Furlanetto:2006p2267,Pritchard:2012p9555,zaroubi2013epoch}.
  
Direct detection of HI during the Epoch of Reionization (cosmological redshifts $5<z<13$) is currently the goal of several new radio arrays.  The signal is faint; initial detection is being sought in the power spectrum.

In section XXX we describe our observations strategy, in section XXX calibration, imaging and foreground removal, in section XXX power spectrum estimation, and conclude in XXX.
