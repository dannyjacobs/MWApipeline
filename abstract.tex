The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Western Australia is currently
performing thousand hour integrations in the 2~m radio band with the goal of
detecting redshifted 21~cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) when the first stars are expected to reionize the
universe on cosmological scales. Our goal is to observe the power spectrum of inter-galactic hydrogen as reionization
proceeds and constrain the timing and speed of this key step in the universeâ€™s development. Because deep 21~cm power spectrum observations are very new and require unprecedented levels of precision and foreground removal, we have developed multiple analysis pipelines with redundant cross-checking at each major processing stage to increase our confidence in the reliability of the analysis. In this paper we describe the two parallel analysis pipelines that will be used to analyze the MWA EoR data and present initial power spectra and quality checks from the first nights of EoR observing with the full MWA instrument.
