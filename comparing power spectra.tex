\subsection{Power Spectra}
We've got four power spectra (figure). The two "main" pipelines, and the cross-checks. They look more or less the same. Some of the differences stem from operational limitations on the total bandwidth produced by the RTS (in the process of being increased) and the amount of time averaging done.
